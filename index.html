<p>The Appear Charms change your appearance, and produce other illusions. Seekers and Troubadours
    have affinity for them.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Flair Emotion (Appear •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Unrolled<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> Lasting</p>
    <p>The Princess takes a Wisp’s worth of emotional energy and releases it into the air. To psychic empaths,
    Princesses using Passion’s Light, and similar abilities it shines like a flair and can be used as a signal.
    Usually no roll is required, the Princess spends the Wisp and barring a large distraction any empath in
    the area will notice, but a Composure + Empathy roll may be used to get into the right emotional state
    if the Nakama have agreed to use specific emotions as specific signals.
    An alternative use for this Charm is to release the Wisp in close proximity to an empath, this hits
    like a flashbang and triggers a Presence + Empathy vs Composure + Supernatural advantage roll. If
    the Princess wins the roll she inflicts an appropriate Tilt for either a turn or one turn per success. The
    Tilt chosen depends on how the target senses emotions and the duration depends on the severity of the
    Tilt. A character who hears emotions might take Stunned for one turn, or Deafened for several turns.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Grey Masquerade (Appear •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Manipulation + Empathy<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 24 hours</p>
    <p>Princesses enjoy powerful protection to keep their secret identity secret but not everyone is so lucky.
        Beacons cannot hide the unusual amount of Light they produce by storing it inside a Transformed self.
        Sworn are visibly under an enchantment. So helpful Princesses can use this Charm to disguise the signs.
        After all, if your goal is to give your sister the magic she needs to fly away from danger painting a target
        on her back defeats the purpose.
        This Charm can only be used on Beacons, Sworn, or Shikigami. It is commonly known by Shikigami
        who travel independently to seek out Princesses to mentor.</p>
        <div class="failsucc"><i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess accidentally sends out a flair of magic, perceivable over a reasonable
        distance by anyone who can sense such things.<br>
        <i>Failure:</i> The target’s supernatural nature raiment.<br>
        <i>Success:</i> The target takes the Masquerade Condition, any passive supernatural power which would
        detect their supernatural nature, such as the Charm Reflected Light, will automatically fail. Active
        supernatural powers, such as the Charm A Magical Girl’s Eyes, must overcome a Clash of Wills against
        whoever invoked this Charm. If it cannot overcome the illusion the target registers as a completely
        normal human (or a completely normal something else in the case of Shikigami). This Charm provides
        no protection to active uses of power by the Charm’s subject. If a Sworn activates his Practical Magic
        near someone with Reflected Light they will feel it as normal.<br>
        <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The duration lasts a whole week.</div>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Close the Third Eye (Acqua ••)</b><br>
        By studying esoteric lore of the human mind the Princess can learn to shield a mortal psychic’s
        signature. This changes the Dicepool to Wits + Occult, apart from that the Charm works as normal.<br></p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Grand Ballroom</b><br>
        <b>Cost: +1 Willpower</b><br>
        The Princess can mask the enchantments she or another Princess created, hiding it from discovery
        through abilities like A Magical Girl’s Eyes. She could invoke Grand Ballroom upon artwork enchanted
        by Living Image, a character under the effects of a Bless Charm, an inanimate object with the Held 
        Charm Condition, or any other magic that lingers after the invocation of a Charm, Privilege, or Edict.
        As with regular uses of Grey Masquerade the illusion can be penetrated through a Clash of Wills.
        If the Charm the Princess wishes to hide works on a Sanctuary scale the roll becomes an Extended
        Action with a target number equal to twice the Sanctuary’s size. If the Princess hides the Consecrated
        Condition then the duration extends until the end of the Consecrated Condition and it will hide all
        Charms that are built atop the Condition.<br></p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Gold Masque (Aria ••)</b><br>
        <b>Cost: +2 Wisps</b><br>
        The Princess’ ability to mask a supernatural nature grows more potent, strong enough to hide a
        Transformed Princess.<br></p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Perennial Veils (Lacrima •••)</b><br>
        <b>Cost: +1 Willpower Dot</b><br>
        The Charm’s Duration extends to Indefinite.<br></p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Funerary Masque (Lacrima ••••)</b><br>
        The Princess’ twists her ability to conceal the supernatural, and instead conceals the mundane from
        supernatural eyes. Any supernatural being must make a Clash of Wills in order to notice the target.
        If they fail the contest they will only remember the target as a generic unimportant person and will
        never directly interact with them. A hungry Darkspawn who’s willing to eat any human it can find
        will fail to consider the target even if no other options are available. Princesses are a special case to
        this rule, Funerary Masque has no effect upon them in their mundane form, but applies while they are
        in their Transformed identity.</p>
       <p>Funerary Masque can only be invoked upon Mortals and Beacons.</p><br>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Light The Way (Appear •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Unrolled<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> Inner Light or Invocation Hours</p>
The Princess can, at any time, create a soft light that banishes the thickest natural darkness. The light source can take any source the princess wishes, from a torch or a glowing halo to a simple ambient glow. She can bring the light up or douse it reflexively, and set it to shine at any intensity short of full sunlight. The Noble can also focus the light to a bright, narrow beam into someone’s eyes to inflict temporary blindness. This is a normal attack using Dexterity + Athletics, and the target’s Defence applies. On a normal success the target is Blinded [CofD 281] in one eye; on an exceptional success he is Blinded in both eyes. Either way, the Tilt lasts for one turn.
<br/></p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Dazzling (Fuoco •)</b>
<br/>
The Noble can reflexively make her light burn at a constant eye-watering intensity, blinding anyone nearby who looks at her, by spending a Wisp. Anyone who can see her must succeed on a Stamina + Composure roll, penalized by the Noble’s Fuoco, or be Blinded in one eye until he looks away from her, or she dims her light again, whichever comes first.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Gone With The Wind (Appear • Aria •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Reflexive<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Dexterity + Stealth vs Wits + Composure<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> Lasting</p>
<p>For a few crucial seconds the Princess becomes elusive and all eyes slide off her. This Charm may be
    invoked reflexively when someone is attempting to track or follow the Princess. Each subsequent attempt
    to use this Charm on the same person in a scene grants a cumulative +3 bonus to their Contesting roll.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess attracts attention. The target may reroll to track the Princess and
    takes the better result.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Princess’ appearance and raiment are unchanged.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The target is suddenly dazed and cannot spot the Princess, he must scramble to find her
    again. All successes on his last roll are removed but he may try again the next turn, assuming the
    Princess hasn’t used this that time to vanish. If the Princess is attempting to pick the target’s pocket,
    or some similar instant action, this essentially gives her a second try at a Contested roll. If the target
    beats her mundane roll then so long as she has a single Success she can use this Charm to erase her
    opponents successes and win the mundane roll.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> In addition to the usual effects the Princess’ first Stealth roll in the next few
    turns gains 8again.
</div>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">A Minute of Silence (Appear • Lacrima •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Reflexive, unrolled or Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Dexterity + Stealth vs Wits + Composure<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Princess spends a wisp and shrouds herself in science. All attempts to locate her by listening fail
    automatically, though the right supernatural power may trigger a Clash of Wills. Moreover, she may
    spend a Wisp and roll Dexterity + Stealth vs Wits + Composure to make an object or person she touches
    totally silent for a number of turns to her Lacrima.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> A banshee like wail emanates from somewhere close to the Princess for a turn.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> Nothing happens.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess inflicts the Silenced Tilt on her target.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> If targeting a living being the Princess also inflicts the Shaken Tilt through the
    sheer wrongness of not being able to hear one’s own body.
</div>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Tranquillise (Appear • Legno •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Composure + Survival<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Princess wraps herself in an illusion of a peaceful glade.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess takes the Sensory Overload Condition and is considered to be in an
    uncomfortable environment until the scene ends.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> Nothing happens.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> For the remainder of the scene, or until she ends the Charm, the Princess can hear nothing
    but a gentle stream in the distance, she smells nothing but a spring breeze, and the temperature feels
    cool and dry. If the environment is extreme enough to cause actual harm the Princess will still feel
    pain even though she feels like she is at a comfortable temperature. This Charm is usually used to
    remove situational penalties when trying to study, meditate, or fall asleep.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> For the duration of the Charm the Princess takes the Blessing Condition and
    adds +2 to all meditation rolls.
</div>
<b>Drawback: </b>The Princess takes the Deafened tilt for the duration of the Charm, and cannot smell either.
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Zephyr's Track (Appear • Aria •)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Dexterity + Stealth<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> Scene/Lasting</p>
<p>The Noble floats through the world like a breeze, leaving no trace of her passing except by her own will.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Noble becomes clumsy, prone to slip and make noise when she wants to hide.
    She takes a -2 penalty on all Stealth dice pools until the scene ends.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Noble leaves traces of herself behind her as usual.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> Gentle puffs of air follow the Noble, cleaning away any traces the Noble leaves in the wake
    of her movements. Footprints and fingerprints are brushed away; hairs and skin cells float behind her
    without settling; drops of sweat or blood evaporate. Any attempt to follow her trail or deduce her
    actions from physical evidence fails. This wind follows the Princess for one scene, but it’s effects are
    Lasting.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Noble can choose to leave false evidence behind her that suggests a person
    quite unlike herself passed where she has gone.
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Multiple</b><br>
Modified by commonality.<br>
The breezes can clear away traces of many people at once. The Noble uses the Charm on the members
of an organization she can see, using the Commonalty modifier. If she succeeds, all traces of their
passing are erased.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Phantom (Appear ••)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Wits + Expression<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Princess forms a Wisp into an illusory object. The illusion affects only sight, and material objects
    pass through it without stopping. The Size of the image is limited to 2 + Inner Light or any applied
    Invocation, but within that limit she can show any image she is capable of imagining.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Charm fails with a burst of light and a loud crack, alerting anyone nearby who
    could see or hear to the Princess’s presence.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> No image appears.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess creates the image she desires, somewhere within her sensory range. The image
    remains until the Charm ends. The Princess may manipulate the image for no cost, for example
    she could make an illusionary person walk around but could not turn it into an illusionary car. This
    requires her full attention, if a roll is required the dicepool is Wits + Expression though the Storyteller
    may nominate a different dicepool if the situation warrants it. E.G. Wits + Subterfuge to make an
    illusionary person decieve someone. Intelligence + Academics to create an illusionary chalkboard with
    accurate scientific equations.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Princess manipulates her illusion deftly. Her mundane actions to control it
    gain a +2 bonus.
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Dancing</b><br>
    The Princess may create an image that moves without her conscious attention. When her concentration
    lapses, the image continues to act on the instructions she last gave it.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Glowing</b><br>
    Requires Light the Way<br>
    The Princess can make her illusions give off light, just as her Regalia does with Light the Way. As long
as she is concentrating on an image, she may vary the light coming from it reflexively, independently
of her personal light. If she has upgraded Light the Way, she may apply all that Charm’s upgrades to
the image’s light as if it were her own.</p> 
<p><b>Upgrade: Consecrated</b><br>
    The Princess may sustain a Lasting illusion with the blessing of a Consecrated area. Doing to keeps
the illusion intact until the Consecrated Condition ends, but limits its movements to the area covered
by the Condition.</p>   
<p><b>Upgrade: Singing</b><br>
    The Princess may create an illusory sound, or add sound to an illusory image. A sound without an
image seems to come from any point the Princess can see, which she can move while concentrating.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Solid</b><br>
    The image becomes substantial. As long as it lasts it has a degree of solidity, as well as a firmness and
texture appropriate to what it depicts. However, just because it projects an image of solidity does not
mean it is solid; the image shatters if force is applied to it (by kicking an illusionary wall, for example)
or with it (an illusionary wrench won’t tighten or loosen a bolt).</p>  
<p><b>Upgrade: Thinking (Acqua ••)</b><br>
    Requires Dancing<br>
When the Princess releases her concentration, in addition to providing the illusion with further
instructions she may grant it a measure of adaptability. For each dot of Acqua she may instruct the
image to recognise one condition and react in response. The illusion has mundane senses within the
human range. If a roll is required the illusion has a dicepool equal to the Princess’ Acqua, for an
illusionary watchman who sounds the alarm when someone approaches and could roll Acqua to
contest stealth.</p>  
<p><b>Upgrade: Multiplied (Aria ••)</b><br>
Requires Dancing<br>
The Princess may create multiple distinct images with a single Charm activation. She can make one
image for each dot of her Aria; for each image beyond the first, the maximum Size of all the images
is reduced by 1. The Princess can try to control more than one image at once but takes a -2 penalty
to her dice pool for each image beyond the first. If she applies Singing, each image may have its own
sound and images can be replaced with sounds, but the number of distinct illusions remains limited
to her Aria.</p>  
<p><b>Upgrade: Scented (Legno ••)</b><br>
The Princess may create an illusory scent, or add scent to an illusory image or sound. If the image
is Solid, she can give it a taste as well. A scent without an image seems to come from a point the
Princess can see, which she can move while concentrating.</p> 
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Face of Lover's Alarm (Appear •• Specchio ••)</button>
<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Reflexive<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Manipulation + Empathy vs Wits + Composure<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<p>One would not threaten a loved one, would they? And as the Queen of Mirrors teaches, the True Heir
will be beloved by all. This Charm is activated in response to an attack before the target rolls and the
Princess must be able to apply her Defence to the attack.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The target sees the Noble as a perverted mockery of one they love, and gain +3
    dice on their attack roll. They cannot be affected by this Charm for the reminder of the scene.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The target sees through the illusion and cannot be affected by this Charm for the reminder
    of the scene.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Noble’s face shifts into someone the target loves and they are compelled to react
    appropriately, pulling their blow aside before the Princess can be hurt. The wasted attack still
    consumes their action for the turn. They also take the Blessing Condition and gain +3 dice to resist
    this Charm for the remainder of the scene.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> As above, and the target takes some small Tilt. They might unbalance themselves
    and take Knocked Down. 
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Inviolate (Specchio •••)</b><br>
    <b>Cost:</b> +1 Willpower<br>
    Just as the Princess shifts into someone the target loves, someone else in reach of the target’s weapon
takes the Princess’ form. The Princess nominates another person within range of the attacker’s weapon,
if she wins the Contested roll the target must attack them instead.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Doomed (Specchio ••••)</b><br>
    <b>Cost:</b> +1 Willpower<br>
    Does the mirror reflect the truth, or does it show things how they should be? If the individual whom
the Noble mimics is present, and within the attack range of the form of weapon used to attack her, the
attack is transferred to them. If the Princess wins the contested roll the target must make an attack
roll against the her, subtracting her Defence as normal, but the damage goes to their loved one. In
the case of a melee weapon, the target might swing wide and hit their friend; for a ranged weapon, it
can be more improbable, as ricochets, arcing electrical conduits, and exploding fire extinguishers all
conspire to hurt their ally. If the loved one has armour or similar protections they apply as normal.

<p>The movements of the Princess’ body are saturated by meaning. She uses this Charm on a single
    individual who can see her.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Noble destroys her natural ability to communicate. All her Expression rolls
    take a -2 penalty for the rest of the scene.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Noble’s gestures convey no special meaning.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Noble can convey the most complicated thoughts to her target with a turn of the head, a
    twist of the hand, or a facial expression, as quickly as with normal speech; the target will understand
    her intent even if he shares no languages with her, as long as they can see her. Nobody else looking

<p>The Princess encodes a message into a seemingly innocuous display. First she must create a physical
    display to contain her message, and it could be anything. She could arrange her collection of stuffed
    toys into a symbolic order, or write a letter with a second coded message. Then she names the recipient
    or recipients. She may choose one person, a group (applying a Commonality modifier), a Court or the
    Nobility as a whole (at -5).</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess message is not hidden as well as she thinks. At some point in the
    future the Storyteller should introduce a problem caused by it falling into the wrong hands.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The charm fails to activate.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess creates a message which contains roughly as much information as one minute’s
    worth of speech per success. Regular speech, not the Royal Tongue. When any of the intended
    recipients examines the object containing they immediately know it is significant. No roll is necessary
    to decode the message but some time and attention might be. If the object is destroyed or significantly
    modified or damaged the hidden message is lost. If the message falls into the hands of anyone but the
    intended recipient they will not be able to decrypt it without magic and a Clash of Wills.<br>

<b>Cost:</b> 3 Wisps<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>Sometimes a Princess just needs to wow a crowd. With this Charm a Princess can summon her own
    support team with a maximum of Inner Light members.
    Before casting Summon Backup Dancers the Princess must declare what kind of action they’re going
    to support. The Princess could declare singing in which case they’d be able to perform dance routines or
    backup vocals. The Princess could declare painting and summon a model to paint. The backup dancers
    primary task must involve giving some sort of performance, she cannot summon a team of stage hands
    and set them wiring up her stage.</p>
    <p>Backup dancers are solid but only when performing the task they were created, an actor would be
    able to interact with props, and wear costumes, but would not be able to fetch a cup of coffee. A cunning
    Princess might still be able to use them for other roles, she might ask her trope to dance around waving
    their arms in front of her enemies face while she hides, or to attack foes who don’t realise the backup
    dancers cannot hurt them. (Assume a 1 die pool on any social actions, mental and physical tasks fail
    automatically). If attacked a single point of Damage, even Bashing, causes a Backup dancer to vanish
    into a puff of ephemera appropriate to the Princess.</p>
    <p>A Princess can only have one instance of Summon Backup Dancers active at a time.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> You summon Inner Light performers but have no control over them. They

    <i>Failure:</i> No dancers appear.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Noble creates several assistants. The crew acts as equipment for the chosen task, giving
    an equipment bonus equal to the Successes rolled (maximum of 5) to the Noble, or to anyone else she tells them to help. However, they carry the Volatile Condition [CofD 102]. If the Princess performs

<div class="content">
<p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
<b>Dice Pool:</b> Intelligence + Crafts<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 2+ Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> Variable</p>
<p>“I can’t be in two places at once!” is an all-too-common complaint from just about anyone; the Hopeful
    especially find it necessary to be two people at once, when mundane obligations interfere with fighting
    a supernatural incursion. With this Charm a Princess can partly resolve such dilemmas, by making a
    facsimile of her mundane self that moves and speaks, and can pass as herself if not examined too closely.
    To use the Charm, the Princess must have a mass of material that she can shape barehanded, or else
    a quantity of fluid, of roughly Size 2. Infusing this material with Wisps, she transforms it into an Astral
    Droplet: an exact physical copy of herself just before her last transformation, wearing identical clothing.
    The Droplet has the same mundane Attributes and Skills as its creator, and access to all her memories
    as of the time of its creation. However, it lacks energy and imagination; it does not get 10-again on
    any dice pool, or any other quality that allows rerolling dice, cannot spend Willpower, and has neither
    Virtue nor Vice. The Droplet is also fragile - a single point of damage of any type is enough to dissolve
    it into the stuff it was made of and glimmers of light. Finally, the Droplet has none of the Princess’
    Light-derived powers, not even Practical Magic.</p>
    <p>The Droplet’s basic duration is 30 minutes for each activation success. The Princess may choose to
    extend the duration by spending more Wisps than the minimum of 2 - each extra Wisp doubles the
    time before the Droplet disintegrates, cumulatively. She cannot, however, spend more Wisps for this
    purpose than half her Inner Light, rounded up. She may choose the total number of Wisps spent after
    the activation roll, though she must spend at least 2. She may end the Charm prematurely by touching
    the Droplet and concentrating for a turn. A Princess cannot create a second Droplet before the first
    Droplet dissolves - the Charm just fails if she tries.</p>
    <p>By default the Droplet is an automaton which follows any instruction given to it which does not
    pose a threat of physical harm, and otherwise stays wherever it is put; it takes no action on its own. If
    the material used to make it resonates with an Invocation the Princess may apply that Invocation to
    the Charm (Aria uses thick mist or smoke, or a strong breeze, Lacrima can use total darkness or dark
    shadow.) Droplets so formed have some initiative and the rudiments of a personality; in the absence of
    clear instructions they follow the tenets of the applied Invocation, to the extent allowed by the knowledge
    and abilities the Princess possesses.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Integrated</b><br>
It’s often useful to know what your double has been doing during your absence. If the Princess dissolves
her Droplet prematurely by touching it and concentrating, she can recall to memory a description of
the actions the Droplet took and the events it saw and heard. A roll to recall any detail of the account
is at -2 in addition to any other penalties.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Lifelike (Specchio •••)</b><br>
A Lightbringer can use that indescribable quality that makes her reflection “her reflection”instead of
a simple image and use it to place mind and will into the Droplets they make. To apply Lifelike the
Princess needs a reflecting surface large enough to hold an image of her upper body; she takes the
hands of her image and pulls it out of the surface. The resulting Droplet is flipped left-to-right, and
with the opposite dominant hand. The real difference though, is that the Droplet gains a nearly-human
initiative and will; it has the Belief dots, Virtues and Vice of its creator, gets 10-again on its dice pools,
can benefit from other qualities that permit rerolls, and may spend and regain Willpower (though it
begins with none.) The only supernatural ability the Droplet possesses is the ability to Transform and benefit from Transformed skills and attributes, created by Specchio it possesses the Queen of Mirror’s
Practical Magic. The first time the Princess creates this Droplet, its personality exactly matches her
own (including any forms of madness) and aside from the physical inversion they can’t be told apart.</p>
<p><b>Drawback: </b>By invoking a Lifelike a Princess is summoning an independent being. The Droplet’s
personality does not vanish when its body dissolves; it returns to being her reflection, until she makes
another Lifelike Droplet. At that moment it returns and inhabits the new-made body. Since the
droplet is created from a reflection it sees nothing wrong with going back behind the mirror (and finds
acting independently a bit weird and uncomfortable, but nobody said being a Princess or her reflection
was easy). However every time the Princess invokes Lifelike there is a chance that Specchio’s madness
will infect her Droplet. Each time it inhabits a new body the Droplet rolls Resolve + Composure,
with a -2 penalty if the Princess is suffering from Specchio induced madness. If she fails, the Droplet’s
falls to Specchio’s arrogance; she is convinced of her excellence and her right to rule, and resents the
Princess taking her rightful limelight. The Droplet will do what it can to avoid returning to behind
the mirror. It can lengthen the Charm’s duration by spending its own Willpower; it may spend 1
point each day for this, which adds 24 hours of continued embodiment. (The Droplet cannot do this
if the Resolve + Composure check succeeds.)</p>
<p>Just what the Droplet does is up to the Storyteller, but it should avoid Compromising the Princess’
own Beliefs.</p>
<p>If the Princess applies Integrated and Lifelike, all her memories since the Droplet’s first creation become
available to it on the same terms as its are available to her after she dissolves it. Other than that,
neither personality can remember what the other has done.

<b>Dice Pool:</b> Manipulation + Stealth<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Wisp<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Princess shies out of view entirely. She becomes both physically invisible and mentally invisible as
    people find themselves incapable of focusing on evidence of her activities. If she opens a door and walks
    through nobody will notice the door move, though they may unconsciously move to avoid being hit by
    the door.</p>
<p>Any use of Charms ends this power, as does Swords or Tears’ Practical Magic. Any act of violence,
    or any act that could be described as “attention grabbing” such as yelling or jumping up and down while
    waving your arms ends the effect.</p>
<p>This protection extends to anyone viewing a recording or photo of the Princess that is both made and
    viewed during the current scene. However once the Charm ends so does her psychic invisibility, meaning
    that evidence of her activity will no longer be ignored. If she is caught on camera opening a door then
    once the Charm ends anyone reviewing the footage will see a door mysteriously open by itself.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Noble makes herself memorable without realizing it. She takes the Inverse
    Curse Condition, all Perception rolls to notice her take a +2 bonus for the rest of the scene.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> Nothing happens.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess stops emitting any light in the visible spectrum and clouds the minds of any who
    might notice her regardless. She is essentially impossible to notice with mundane senses. Supernatural
    senses allow a Clash of Wills roll to penetrate the Princess’ invisibility. A mortal who suspects
    the Princess is present my track her by looking for footsteps, opening doors, or other evidence of her
    passing. This requires an Extended Wits + Investigation roll with a target of the Princess’ Composure
    + Stealth + Inner Light. Even with useful equipment like an infra-red camera it will take a while for
    the tracker to force his mind to except that heat patch is the Princess and not a glitch or passer by.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Princess can shout and wave her arms as much as she wants. Unless she
    intends for someone to notice her the Charm will not end. Violence, Charms and Swords or Tear’s
    practical magic will still end the Charm.
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Collective</b><br>
    The Princess can hide an entire group by applying the Commonality modifier.

    Using another Charm does not automatically end this Charm, though the results of the Charm are
not masked, neither are any flashes or sparkles created as a side effect.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Full Spectrum (Acqua ••)</b><br>
    The Princess’ invisibility extends into the infra-red and ultra-violet spectrum. In addition the mental
effects of the Charm extend to affect mundane technology, making her all but invisible to all
technological means. A door that is set to issue an alarm when it is opened will remain silent unless
the Princess leaves it open when the charm ends or someone else jostles it.

    <i>Success:</i> The target suffers phantom bashing damage, equal to the number of boxes with damage of
    any type on the Princess’ Health track or his unmarked Health boxes, whichever is less. The target
    suffers wound penalties from this damage if it goes into the last three boxes, and must check their
    Stamina to remain conscious if it fills the last box, as normal. However, the damage is not real; it
    vanishes when the Charm ends as if it were healed, and if the target takes real bashing damage when
    the track is full, that damage replaces the phantom damage instead of wrapping into lethal damage.
    Phantom damage also has no effect if the target has no empty Health Boxes to fill. The phantom
    damage can also be healed magically, or mitigated as it’s inflicted by targets who have that ability.<br>

    doesn’t beat the target’s successes, he realizes that this person is an illusion within moments. If she
    does get more successes, the target will treat the imaginary person as fully real, and respond to it as

    “open bazaar”, “African jungle” and “undersea grotto” are all valid themes.) Permanent fixtures
    are always changed; she can choose whether to change people’s possessions, but cannot affect some
    possessions and not others. As long as the Charm lasts, the changed objects look, sound, feel and even
    smell like what they appear to be; observers may make Perception rolls to spot something wrong with

    to Bashing damage, or negate all but the first point of Bashing damage. The Aegis may spend the

<b>Cost:</b> 3 Wisps, 1 Willpower<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 scene</p>
<p>The Queen of Clubs’ avatar is guardian and teacher of the beasts. The Princess undergoes a second
    transformation on activating the Charm, assuming traits that suggest a large and powerful animal –
    typically a lion, though bear-like and eagle-like miens are known, and there are rumors of one Hopeful
    who evokes a dragon. The change always suggests a king or queen of beasts, and the peril and majesty
    of the natural world; any mortal seeing the Princess is somewhat shaken, and she gains +1 on all
    Intimidation rolls against them until the Charm ends.</p>
<p>However, the main effect of the Charm is on beasts who see it. Any natural animal that can perceive
    the Princess when she activates the Charm has its Intelligence raised by 1 dot, becoming sapient. Further,
    the animals affected gain instant fluency in her native language, and the Charm grants them the ability
    to speak it comprehensibly if they have any ability to vocalize at all. The Princess may use Social
    Skills on the animals as she would with mortals, and gains a bonus on such rolls equal to her activation
    successes. When the Charm ends, the animals return to their former non-sapient state. If the Princess
    use the Charm twice on the same animal, it remembers everything that happened during the first use.</p>

    (no other Commonality group may be used; Lacrima may not be magically linked to Alhambra, but the
    avatar of Alhambra’s Lady certainly is).</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess fails utterly to protect her allies, and is crushed. She looses a point of
    Willpower and cannot spend or regain Willpower for the rest of the scene. In other words, she gains
    the Depression Condition but automatically suffers it’s full effects without needing to fail in her goals
    first.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Princess cannot protect her allies. The Charm fails.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess undergoes a second transformation that drains all the colour from her body and
    Regalia. All members of the target group who can see this transformation feel a breath of cold pass
    over them, penetrating through all clothing for a moment.<br>
    Until the Charm ends, the transformation expands and substantially modifies the Princess’ Holy Shield;
creating the Sheltering Hand Tilt: When anyone affected takes damage the Princess automatically
protects them by spending Wisps at her usual rate for Holy Shield. If she does not have sufficient
Wisps she drains the land around her, for each Wisp drained roll one die and create a point of Taint
per Success.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Princess touches the determination that has sustained the Queen of Tears
    in her mission. She also gains the Blessing Condition. The affected trait is Inner Strength rolls and
    the increase is 2. The Blessing ends when the Sheltering Hand Tilt does so.
</div>
<p><b>Drawback: </b>The Queen of Tears perpetually mourns for the lost Kingdom, and the sacrifices that must
    be made to sustain its remnant; her avatar bears the burden of her grief, and so also gains the Queen’s
    Grief Tilt. At the end of every turn where she protected someone with this Charm roll Resolve +
    Composure:<br>

        <i>Success:</i> The Princess takes a -1 penalty to all future Resolve + Composure rolls to maintain Sheltered

    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Charm works in reverse, making the Princess naive and awestruck by new
    people. She applies the Fresh Impression condition to herself, increasing her impressions of anyone she
    hasn’t already formed an opinion about by one step.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> Nothing happens.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> Until the Charm ends she automatically applies the Fresh Impressions Condition to anyone
    she interacts with for the first time as well as anyone who has spoken to the Princess before but has
    no opinion about her. Essentially, if the phrase “first impressions ” fits then the Charm functions.
    The Condition increases the target’s impression by one step beyond what they would naturally be. In
    addition so long as the Charm is action the Princess removes any penalties for lacking a Speciality to

<p>A Noble is a creature of divides; between Light and Dark, Transformed and mundane, Hope and despair.
    Drawing a line on the ground, she separates one area from another, and so becomes aware of anyone that
    crosses that line. Before this Charm can be used, the Noble must first make some kind of line or divide
    to empower, such as a chalk line drawn on tarmac, a rope thrown down, or even putting up a picket
    fence around a house. This is a mundane activity, unrelated to the actual use of the Charm, and these
    divides can be linear, or enclose an area. It can also empower pre-existing divides, such as a doorway,
    or a river. These divides must either measure no more than (Inner Light x 20) yards in any direction,
    or be in an area affected by the Consecrated Condition.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess’s clumsy magic temporarily manages to scramble her memories. She
    gains the Lost Condition, she is no longer able to remember how place connects to place.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Charm fails to activate, with a slightly pathetic spluttering noise.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The divide is empowered, gaining the Line in the Sand Condition. She nominates certain
    targets and instantly knows if they cross the line (and which line, if she has more than one active). The
    Princess can nominate everyone, a single individual, or she may nominate a social group by adding
    Commonality to her roll. By default the duration one scene. If used on a permanent natural divide,
    such as a doorway, fence or across a bridge, the duration is increased to one day. If used on Consecrated
    ground the duration is until the area is no longer Consecrated.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The magic flows easily, the divide feeling natural, and so the Princess is refunded
    the Wisp cost for the Charm.

mundane component.

<p>A Princess is royalty and may be called upon to witness a contract in her official capacity. This charm
    may be invoked upon any written or spoken contract, but everyone with obligations must be present and
    consent to the Princess bearing witness. This Charm is a lot less powerful than some Princesses wish,
    it can only work with clear and discrete actions and stands no chance when used on something like a
    corporate merger.</p>
<p>If the Princess wishes she can invoke this Charm multiple times to ensure that all signatories to the
    contract uphold their obligations.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> Instead of creating a connection to the contract the Princess just gives herself a
    headache. She takes moderate Sick Tilt for the scene.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> Nothing happens.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess connects herself to one signatory of the contract, and knows when the terms
    are fulfilled or broken, but only for clear and discrete actions. If a contract required a mechanic to
    deliver a car in good repair by Saturday the Princess would know the moment he delivered the car or
    the deadline passed with no delivery, but she would have no clue if the car is in good repair without
    walking over and checking herself. Unlike most such powers Royal Witness works on the spirit of the
    agreement and not the letter. If the mechanic got one of his employees to deliver the car on his behalf
    that would fulfil the contract unless either party considered it important that he made the delivery
    personally.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> No further benefit.

    try to search her or detain her, no matter what she’s been doing, though if she lacks permission to be

Collective on an organisation large enough to have a Status Merit she gains the Blessing Condition
adding half her Terra (rounding up) in Status to an organisation. This organisation cannot be
supernatural in nature (which includes any organisation that offers a supernatural Merit or
Endowment as a benefit to members). In addition to Status the Princess knows how to talk and act
like a member of the organisation, and if she has appropriate Charms (such as Phantom) she knows
how to create accurate markers of identity. However her membership is fragile, she will need to come
up with her own reasons for why nobody has met her before and if she gives people a reason to
investigate her membership they will discover the truth.

<p>What need is there of speech between you and those you love? A Princess uses this Charm to
    communicate with another person; if he is not present, the Intimacy modifier applies. If the target has

    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> For the duration, the Princess imagines the voice of her target is speaking to her;

    speak. She takes a -2 penalty on all Wits-based rolls.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Charm has no effect.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess can speak directly to the mind of her target, without using her voice, and the
    target can reply the same way. The Charm conveys only sounds that the Princess and the target could
    actually speak; so, for example, if one thinks in a language the other doesn’t know, he hears the words but cannot understand them. On the other hand, anything said is heard as clearly as if the two of
    them stood together in a quiet room. The first time someone is the target of this Charm, he must roll
    Resolve + Composure to learn how to speak through the link (and, possibly, to persuade himself that
    he isn’t imagining the voice in his head.)<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> In addition, by concentrating the Princess and the target can share a memory.
    The one who has the memory makes a memory roll (see p. 44 of the nWoD core book) to recall it;
    whatever she recalls passes over the link, and the other makes a memory roll to retain the information.
    This takes an instant action from both characters.

<b>Cost:</b> 2 Wisps<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 night</p>
<p>The Princess binds her mind to another; when they next fall asleep they will share their dreams. The
    Charm grants both the gift of lucid dreaming for the night and clear memories the morning after. To
    open an Ivory Gate a Princess needs permission from the target, and the pair must sleep close enough
    to touch.</p>
<p>A lesser known use of this Charm is that it interacts with Crawlspaces. Normally the only way into
    another person’s Crawlspace is to travel through the Dreamlands, but while two people are connected
    by an Invocation of Ivory Gate they may see the entrance to each others Crawlspace. Only the owner of
    the Crwalspace may unlock it, but they may lead others through. Every traveller must pay 1 Wisp or
    one Willpower.</p>
<p>The other, even more obscure, use of Ivory Gates is to invoke it on oneself. This seems to be a
    waste of good Wisps, but while she is within her own Crawlspace and under the effects of a self-applied
    Invocation of this Charm, she will be able to navigate from her Crawlspace into a regular dream (and
    yes, she can bring others too but they don’t benefit from lucidity or clear memories unless Ivory Gate is
    invoked upon them). An expensive but effective cure for insomnia or a fun night of lucid dreaming.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Distant</b><br>

phone-call or arranging in advance is sufficient.

<p><b>Upgrade: Dream of Me (Specchio ••)</b><br>
    Modify the roll by Intimacy<br>
    The Princess no longer needs permission to enter another’s dreams, and can even open an Ivory
Gate without giving the gift of lucid dreaming to the other party. This Upgrade can also be used
to invade somebody’s dream from the Dreamlands and even allow a full invasion of another person’s
dreamscape (see Amanojaku in Chapter four for more details on how to access a person’s dream from
the Dreamlands, and how to invade a dreamscape), doing so requires that the Princess navigates
through the Crawlspace into the target’s dream. They may not detour or use the Crawlspace in any
way except as a path into the target’s dreams, this Charm simply doesn’t have the power.

    character. Their lives contain the details relevant to the Heir’s story and nothing else; and by enchanting
    the connections between an individual, a group, and society’s perceptions of that group she can protect
    herself from any inconvenient reality.</p>
<p>Before invoking this charm the Princess must name an archetype that the target could be identified
    with. She could turn an ordinary family man who happens to work as a software engineer into a walking
    talking stereotype of a star trek obsessed socially outcast computer geek, but she couldn’t turn him into
    a corporate raiding wolf of Wall Street banker.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess’ solipsism reaches a fever pitch. She automatically rolls a dramatic
    failure for the Specchio backlash on this charm.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> Nothing happens.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The target takes the Stereotypical condition. Their Vice becomes acting as expected, they
    need to spend a point of willpower to act against their archetype, and they take the Open Condition
    to Spirits or Dreamlanders who align with their archetype.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The duration increases to two scenes.
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Group Identity</b><br>
    The Princess can invoke this Charm on a group, applying Commonality to her roll. The highest dice
pool among her targets contests the roll for the entire group. The Princess must choose the same
archetype for the entire group and any members who cannot be linked to the archetype are exempted
from the Charm’s effects.

<p>The Noble summons and banishes objects in puffs of colored smoke. She can move an object of Size up
    to her successes between her current location and a place she knows of; the Sympathy modifier applies
    to the other place, not to the object, so she can’t summon an object that’s been moved since she last
    saw it. Also, to send an object somewhere the Noble has to be carrying it, and when she takes an object
    it ends up in her hands; the Charm can’t be used on anything the Noble can’t lift.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Shuffled</b><br>

<p>In the myths, the songs of Orpheus were so beautiful that all the natural world came to hear them.
    The Princess can, in a small way, emulate him. When she has a natural animal within sight, she sings
    or plays music pleasing to it, and all the animals of the same species who hear the song gather together
    to listen. The Charm ensures that the music can be heard anywhere within 100 times her successes in
    yards; natural acoustics may carry the song further, at the Storyteller’s discretion. (Note that while only
    animals of the same kind as the target are certain to come, anyone and anything with ears can follow the
    music if they like.) Once they arrive, the summoned animals will stand or lie near the Princess, quietly
    listening, as long as she performs; when she stops, the Charm ends and the beasts revert to their normal
    behavior in the following turn.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Calling (Legno •••)</b><br>
    The Princess may perform for an animal that is not within sight, provided she knows it well. Apply
the Intimacy modifier to the chosen target; animals of that species will come to hear her.

<p>A student of Acqua must tell the truth, but mere honesty doesn’t convince everyone. The Noble can

    on a person or a social group by applying Commonality.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Noble achieves the opposite of her intent: those who hear her assume she lies.
    She takes the Cursed Condition and suffers a -2 penalty on Social rolls to communicate or persuade
    people for the rest of the scene, and may not use the Charm again until then.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Noble’s words are as convincing as usual, no more and no less.<br>

    hear her intent clearly. Any mundane attempt by the target determine if she is telling the truth (as

<b>Duration:</b> instant</p>
<p>The Queen of Tears has deemed that all Princesses are entitled to the freedom of her city. To use this
    Charm, the Princess must be in complete darkness; light bright enough to see by, from any source, makes
    the Charm fail.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Noble touches the Dark World through her magic instead of Alhambra. The
    Compromise roll for the Charm takes a -2 penalty, and the Noble cannot use the Charm again for one
    full day.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Noble stays where she is.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The darkness the Noble stands in thickens to an utter negation of light for an instant;
    then the ground vanishes and she falls, splashing into the black salt lake of Alhambra. The Charm is generally considerate enough to drop her near a shore, where she can reach dry land in a single turn.
    It doesn’t, however, have to leave her in a specific place within the city; she may have to walk an hour
    or two to reach the district she wanted.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Noble appears in Alhambra, at the nearest shore to the place she wants to
    be.
</div>
<p>The Charm will not take anyone back from Alhambra - the Queen of Tears does not wish anyone to
leave her who has not proven their fidelity to the true Kingdom
As an incidental benefit, those who learn this Charm can light lamps in Alhambra as its citizens do...
it’s not clear why.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Driven</b><br>
<b>Cost: </b> 1 Wisp/every 5 points of size above size 5<br>
The Princess can drive a vehicle into Alhambra, carrying along all its contents. She takes a penalty
on the activation roll of -2 for 5 points of the vehicle’s Size exceeding 5; that is, a Size 10 vehicle takes
a -2 penalty, a Size 15 vehicle takes -4, and so on. As with the basic effect, the vehicle must be in
darkness to travel, and will arrive over water; most Hopeful using this Charm travel in boats.</p>
<p>If she rolls a dramatic failure, the Princess cannot use the Charm for one full day.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Returning (Lacrima •••)</b><br>
    The Princess may use the Charm to travel from Alhambra to a place she knows well; apply the Intimacy
modifier for the destination. As with the basic Charm, the upgrade only works in complete darkness
(and in Alhambra that carries risk; see the rules in that section.) On the other hand, activating the
Charm to leave Alhambra is not a sin against Belief at any level.</p>
    <p>The followers of Tears only teach this Charm to people who have proven their loyalty to Alhambra,
        but nothing other than the Lacrima Prerequisite and the risk of retaliation prevents anyone else from
        learning the Charm.</p>

<b>Duration:</b> instant</p>
<p>A simple trick but a very useful one. The Princess targets two mirrors before stepping into one
    and out the other. Both mirrors must be large enough for her to fit through. Intimacy is measured to
    place the Princess wishes to arrive at, if it has no Mirrors large enough to squeeze out of the Charm
    automatically fails and the Princess knows why. If it has more than one suitable mirror than the Princess
    can choose to rive at any mirror she knows about. The Intimacy modifier applies to the place the Princess
    wishes to arrive at, but she must know the exact location of the mirror she is to arrive at.</p>
<p>The Charm cannot cross between realms. This may not be used to gain either egress or entrance to
    Alhambra, nor may it be used to exit or leave the hisil of the shapeshifters, the twisted thorn-world of the
    fae-folk, or any other such hidden place. However, should a Princess find herself in any of these alternate
    worlds, it may be used for transit within them if such a thing is possible within the alien dimension.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess enters the mirror, but gets lost. She rolls Wits + Composure each
    turn after using the Charm; when she succeeds, she emerges from the mirror she left. If the mirror is
    shatters in the interim she emerges somewhere nearby.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> Nothing happens.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess transports herself to the target mirror.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> When the Princess emerges, she may immediately move up to her Speed, even if
    she had to move to reach the mirror she left.
</div>
<p><b>Upgrade: Leading</b><br>
<b>Cost: </b> +1 Wisp per additional person<br>
With this Upgrade the Princess can now lead others through mirrors. Each extra person or 5 Size
points of equipment beyond what she can carry costs an additional Wisp.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Seeking (Specchio •••)</b><br>
    With this Upgrade the Princess can use her Intimacy modifier to a person or object instead of a place.
    She will arrive at the nearest appropriate mirror, assuming their is one in Inner Light x50 yards.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Writ of Passage</b><br>
    The Princess learns how to combine her magical mirrors with complementary magic to travel beyond
the world. If she knows a Charm, Edict or Privilege that allows access to another world, or she works
with someone who does, then she may use Mirror Walk and travel to a mirror in that world, Intimacy
permitting. Doing so requires that the activation cost of the other power be paid in full. She may also
use Writ of Passage to return from other worlds –though some worlds are infamous for being easier to
enter than to escape.</p>
<p>The ability Enter Darkness, known to all creatures of the Darkness can be used to walk to a Mirror in
    the Dark World. Ferryman’s Shroud cannot be used to enter Alhambra, the city’s defences are strict
    about what may enter. Realms without physical substance, such as the Dreamlands, are never valid
    destinations for Mirror Walk.

<b>Cost:</b> 2 Wisps, 1 Willpower<br>
<b>Duration:</b> 1 month</p>
<p>In a lengthy ceremony, invoking all she knows of him, the Princess weaves the thread of her fate into
    another’s, becoming an exemplar in his life of one of the Queens. Each Queen teaches a different version
    of this Charm, with her favored Invocation as a prerequisite; these versions must be learned as separate
    Charms.</p>
<p>Unlike natural Entwined Destinies there is no guarantee that the people involved are suited for new
    connection with each other. Even if the target actively resists the effects of selfish or incompetent uses
    of this Charm can be seriously unethical, harmful and just all round messy. Likewise, unlike natural
    Entwined Destinies the Princess doesn’t automatically modify the subject of the Charm’s fate. When
    Fate itself wants to bring two people together it has no reason not to work both ends. When a Princess
    uses magic to twist fate she finds it’s easier to work on her own.</p>
<div class="failsucc">
    <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess cannot use the Charm on the target for 1 month, and suffers a -2
    penalty to all Social rolls involving him during that period.<br>
    <i>Failure:</i> The Princess makes no progress. If she does not reach the threshold, she cannot use the
    Charm on the target again for 1 week.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess makes progress. When she reaches the threshold, the target gains the Blessing
    Condition. The Blessing creates the Entwined Destiny Merit, with the appropraite relationship and
    the target of the Princess’ choice.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Princess makes great progress tying her destiny to the target’s.
</div>
<p>The five versions of the Charm each confer a different form of Entwined Destiny:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Better Living Through Education (Acqua) - Mentor.</b> The Princess gains Willpower when she has
taught the target something important, and takes penalties if she passes up an opportunity to
educate.</li>
    <li><b>Manic Pixie Dust (Aria) - Gadfly.</b> The Princess gains Willpower when she exposes the target to
unusual situations (for him) or alters the pattern of his life in a benign fashion, and takes penalties
if she ignores a chance to do so. Doing the target permanent or serious harm does not fall under
the Destiny.</li>
    <li><b>Red String of Fate (Fuoco) - Lover.</b> The Princess gains Willpower when she has furthered the
target’s love for her, and takes penalties if she misses a chance to do so. The love in question need
not be erotic or marital, but it must involve mutual affection and trust.</li>
    <li><b>Under Ursa’s Star (Legno) - Guardian.</b> The Princess gains Willpower when she rescues the target
from harm, and takes penalties if he is harmed when she is present.</li>
    <li><b>Great Expectations (Terra) - Sponsor.</b> The Princess gains Willpower when her target’s social
standing improves, and takes penaltes if she lets a chance to help him rise go by.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Upgrade: Proxy (Invocation ••••)</b><br>
    The Princess can weave the thread of another person’s life. The threshold for doing so is the Willpower
    of the person being given an Entwined Destiny, and the Intimacy modifier is either the Princess’
    connection to that person, or to the Destiny’s subject, whichever is worse. If either person being given
    a Destiny is not willing to accept the role the Charm gives him, the Princess suffers the effects of a
    dramatic failure towards him.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Mutual (Fuoco ••••)</b><br>
    Requires Red String of Fate<br>
    <b>Cost: </b>1 Willpower<br>
    When the Princess casts Red String of Fate both herself and her beloved gain an Entwined Destiny of
lovers to each other. The two destinies are the natural compliment such as motherly love to daughterly
love, or romantic love to romantic love. If the target does not give informed consent the Princess suffers
a Dramatic Failure.
</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Taut</b><br>
    <b>Cost: </b>+1 Wisp<br>
    The thread that ties the Princess to her target pulls them together. The Princess and her target gain
the Entwined condition. The strenght of the link is equivalent to an Intimate connection of Love,
regardless of the connection they had before. When the Charm ends their Intimacy returns to it’s
natural level.

<p>It is right and proper, the Last Empress teaches, for the Nobility to reward those who serve the Light,
    and punish those who refuse to serve. In a lengthy ceremony, invoking all she knows of him, the Princess
    weaves the thread of another person’s fate, calling him to assist her in her labors.</p>

    <i>Failure:</i> The Princess makes no progress. If she does not reach the threshold, she cannot use the
    Charm on the target again for 1 week.<br>
    <i>Success:</i> The Princess makes progress. When she reaches the threshold, the target’s fate makes him
    a loyal servant of an organisation of the Princess’ choice, until the Charm ends. The target gains
    Willpower when his actions serve the organisation’s goals, and suffers penalties when he flouts them,
    or ignores them to serve another goal. Most Ravens use this Charm to instill loyalty to Alhambra.<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Princess makes great progress weaving the target’s destiny.
</div>
<p>Unlike the Radiant Queens’ Charms of Entwined Destiny, it is perfectly possible to use The Old Allegiance
    on an unwilling target. It is however a Belief compromise to do so, the modifier is at -3 (note that this
    isn’t Lacrima’s Drawback, it’s just very unethical). Further degeneration checks may be called for if the
    Princess takes advantage of people she has woven a destiny for. As a general rule, it doesn’t count as
    consent if they’re only saying it as a result of an artificial destiny.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Collective (Lacrima ••••)</b><br>
<b>Cost: </b> 1 Willpower<br>
The Princess may bind all of a social group to her goals at once. When she reaches the threshold, all
the members of the target group who see her are affected. The Charm is modified by Commonalty of
the target group, instead of by Sympathy.

<b>Dice Pool:</b> Resolve + Composure (1 minute/roll, threshold = 11 - Belief)<br>
<b>Cost:</b> 1 Willpower Dot<br>
<b>Duration:</b> indefinite</p>
<p>The original Sworn Guard and the One-Who-Became-Storms swore this oath when they stood before
    the gates of the last city of the Kingdom, alone against the hordes of the Darkness. And they retain it.
    The Alhambrans know nothing of it; why would those treacherous curs know anything about loyalty or
    devotion? This was an oath of the Army of the Kingdom, not the soft weaklings who betrayed it from
    within.</p>
<p>When using the Charm, the Princess declares a Cause. This may be anything that can be described
    in a sentence or so, consisting of an end-goal that is important to her. For example, “Kill the sixfingered
    man who killed my father” is a valid target, while ”Buy some milk from the shops ” is almost
    certainly not. The Princess repeats these words over and over again, drumming them until they become
    all-consuming. The Charm is complete when the scars blossom across her chest, spelling out the Cause
    for all who would see. Whenever the Princess advances the Cause; finding a list of men with six fingers,
    finding which one he is, finding where he lives, watching his routines, breaking into his house, she gains
    one Willpower. At most one Willpower per scene.</p>
<p>In addition, the Princess cannot be dissuaded; she doubles her appropriate Resistance Attribute
    against any attempts, whether mundane or supernatural, to prevent her from fulfilling the Cause. This
    covers things like torture, which would double Stamina, just as much as Composure might be used
    against magical mind-control or mundane persuasions. However, the Cause consumes those who have
    willingly sworn it. When faced with a choice between advancing or fulfilling the Cause, or taking another
    action, the Princess rolls Resolve + Composure. If she succeeds , she may perform the other action;
    otherwise she must continue with the Cause, and ignore the other situation, even if it would seem to be
    more important to an objective observer.</p>
<p>Once the Cause has been accomplished, the Princess regains the Willpower dot lost when swearing
    to it. If it becomes impossible to attain the Cause for any reason (say, the six-fingered man dies before
    they can get their revenge), not only does she not regain the Willpower dot, she must roll Resolve +
    Composure, with each success inflicting one point of resistant aggravated damage, as her soul seeks
    redemption in coruscating flames that erupt from her mouth and burn at the tongue that swore an oath
    it could not uphold.</p>
<p><b>Upgrade: Proxy (Tempesta ••••)</b><br>

    kind of favor he is destined to seek. He may be a romantic suitor, and fulfil the destiny when he earns
    a sign of her affections. He may seek her social favor, and fulfil the destiny when she compliments him
    on his apparel, or invites him to a party. He may even seek her intellectual favor, and fulfil the destiny
    when she publicly approves of an idea he had. The general rule is that the target gains Willpower when
    the Princess chooses to bestow a sign of her approval upon him, and suffers penalties when he refuses an
    opportunity to seek the Princess’ favor. He does not suffer penalties when he makes a genuine attempt
    to win her favour, regardless of how the Princess reacts.</p>
<p>Unlike the Radiant Queens’ Charms of Entwined Destiny, it is perfectly possible to use Standing on
    a Pedestal on an unwilling target. It is however a Belief Compromise with a -3 penalty to do so (it is not
    a compromise to use it against targets who give informed consent). Further degeneration checks may
    be called for if the Princess takes advantage of people she has woven a destiny for. As a general rule, it

    or the Noble’s activation successes (whichever is less) to the dice they contribute to the primary actor’s
    roll. (For example, in a team of 3, the 2 secondary actors can contribute up to 3 dice, for a total of 6,
    beyond the dice from their rolls.)<br>
    The Princesses leadership also motivates her followers to stand together in the face of adversity, they
also get the Blessing Condition. The affected trait is Resolve, when it is used to resist being dissuaded
from following the Princess’ plan. The Blessing increases their Resolve to the same dots as the Princess’
Presence (if they have a higher Resolve than the Princess’ Presence they get no blessing).<br>
    <i>Exceptional Success:</i> Everyone blessed by this Charm also gains a free point of Willpower.
</div>
<p><b>Drawback: </b> The Princess gains the Burden of Leadership Condition: She gains 8again on Sensitivity
    rolls when someone blessed by this Charm is hurt attempting to follow her orders or does something
    shocking in the process of following the Princess’ leadership. In addition, if anyone blessed by this Charm
    causes her to face a Belief compromise through setting a Bad Example, she does not halve or double the
    perpetrator’s modifier when making her own Compromise roll.<br>
    She also gains the Invocation Lock condition keyed to Terra.

    <p><b>Action:</b> Permanent<br>
    </p>
    <p>Many of the Hopeful have weapons in their Regalia, but some prefer to master control over the ability to
        inflict harm. She may apply an Invocation to rolls to start grappling, to her maneuvers within a grapple,
        and to rolls to touch an opponent without hurting him.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Binding</b><br>
        <b>Cost: </b> 1 Wisp<br>
        The Princess is never without a way to harmlessly restrain her foes for she can manifest the necessary
        equipment by spending a Wisp; it has a Durability equal to her Inner Light or any applied Invocation.
        She must still roll like normal to tie her target up.
    </p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Crushing</b><br>
        While grappling, the Princess delivers immense force in her grasp. She may do either lethal or bashing
        damage to her opponent, once she has a hold on him.
    </p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Grasping</b><br>
        Stacks, up to 3<br>
        Whenever the Princess may apply an Invocation because of the Charm, she always adds a +1 equipment
        bonus for each time she takes this upgrade.
    </p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Penetrating (Acqua •)</b><br>
        The Princess knows how to put opponents out of action quickly. When she applies Acqua to a
        grappling roll, and does damage to her opponent, she rolls dice equal to the damage done. If she gets
        any successes, her opponent must roll his Stamina; if he fails this roll, he is frozen for turns equal to
        the damage done.
    </p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Disarming (Aria ••)</b><br>
        The Princess knows how to put opponents out of action quickly. When she applies Acqua to a
        grappling roll, and does damage to her opponent, she rolls dice equal to the damage done. If she gets
        any successes, her opponent must roll his Stamina; if he fails this roll, he is frozen for turns equal to
        the damage done.
    </p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Blistering (Fuoco ••)</b><br>
        During a grapple, the Princess’ skin and clothes grow hot to the touch. In each turn that she applies
        Fuoco, her opponent automatically takes 1 bashing damage, in addition to any results of manuevers
        that turn.
    </p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Entrancing (Legno ••)</b><br>
        The Princess’ opponents, if once they touch her, find it strangely hard to do anything that would
        really injure her. During a grapple, in any turn the Princess applies Legno, any roll her opponent
        makes that would damage her, either barehanded or with a weapon, is penalized by her Legno.
    </p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Unbroken (Terra ••)</b><br>
        The Princess stands unmoved, and her hold is almost impossible to escape. During a grapple, in any
        turn that she applies Terra, any roll her opponent makes to break the grapple or to render her prone
        is penalized by her Terra.
    </p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Draining (Lacrima ••)</b><br>
        The Princess’ mein unsettles anyone who comes too close. During a grapple, in any turn that she
        applies Lacrima, her opponent must roll Resolve + Composure. If he fails, he cannot do anything that
        turn but try to break the grapple, unless he spends 1 Willpower.
    </p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Shove Nerds Into Lockers (Specchio ••)</b><br>
        The Princess puts those beneath her back into their place with all the strength of an ogre. When she
        starts grappling or makes a maneuver within a grapple she may reflexively spend a Wisp to increase
        her dicepool by the higher of her target’s Intelligence or Academics.

    <div class="content">
        <p><b>Action:</b> Permanent<br>
        </p>
        <p>A melee weapon becomes part of the Princess’ Regalia, manifesting her courage and belief. Initially the
            weapon’s Damage is 3 but when she attacks the Princess may apply an Invocation to add Damage or
            additional dice to her pool, this stacks with any bonus dice from Upgrades. The damage can be either
            Bashing or Lethal and the Princess can swap between them with a Transformation action. The princess
            may also apply an Invocation to boost the weapon’s accuracy, adding the Invocation’s dots directly to
            her attack Dicepool (boosting her weapon counts as the Princess boosting herself, so she may always
            apply Specchio at a reduced Wisp cost). A Princess may wait until after the dice are rolled then boost
            her accuracy or damage, once it is clear where her powers are most needed. If Princesses fight each other
            with Kensai the Princess with the lowest initiative decides where to apply Invocations first. She may
            not apply the same Invocation to both Damage and Accuracy in a single turn but she may apply two
            different Invocations to gain both benefits unless she is using an Invoked Upgrade, which would limit her
            to only applying the linked invocation.</p>
        <p>The Princess chooses either Brawl or Weaponry as the Skill for using her weapon when she learns
            the Charm. The weapon always has a Size between 1 and 4. For anyone but the Princess, the Initiative
            penalty and the minimum Strength needed to use the weapon equals 3 + the Princess’ Inner Light. For
            the Princess herself, both are 0 – as an extension of her beliefs, the weapon obeys her desires as well as
            her own hands.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Accurate</b><br>
            Stacks, up to 3<br>
            The Princess wields her weapon with supernatural skill. Each time the Princess takes this upgrade,
            she gains 1 bonus die when attacking with her weapon.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Cleave</b><br>
            The Princess strikes with a strength or speed that defies physics, hitting multiple
            targets. She may spend a Wisp to use the Autofire rules and attack with a medium burst. All her
            targets must be within striking distance.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Clinging</b><br>
            The Princess’ weapon helps her grapple her foes. Most weapons with this
            upgrade resemble gloves or whips, but some Princess have more unusual ways of binding their foes like
            pinning their shadow with a sword or weakening their control over their muscles with a boink to the
            head.</p>
        <p>With this upgrade a Princess can apply an Invocation to add dice to all mundane grappling rolls so
            long as she is holding her Kensai weapon. If she attempts to do damage while grappling she can also
            apply an Invocation to increase her Damage.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Durable</b><br>
            The Princess’ weapon becomes nearly impossible to break. Add her Inner Light to the weapon’s
            Durability.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Sword Beam</b><br>
            The Princess’ weapon can strike at range using her usual dice pool. Doing so costs one Wisp, the
            weapon range is (20/40/80), and she must apply any Invocations before rolling. Princesses who learn
            this Upgrade are usually skilled Kensai specialists looking for a quick edge when they get into a corner.
            Generalist Champions usually practice with both Kensai and Levinbolt, which sometimes also results
            in sword beams.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Precise (Acqua ••)</b><br>
            The Princess places her strokes with marvelous accuracy. If she applies Acqua, she may ignore up
            to her Acqua in penalties from aiming at a specified target (see pp. 203 in the GMC) on top of the
            Invocation bonus.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Swift (Aria ••)</b><br>
            The Princess strikes quick as a flash, her weapon seems to disappear and reappear inside her opponent’s
            flesh. If the Princess applies Aria to an attack, she gains Armour Piercing equal to her weapon’s
            Damage + Aria, however this significantly reduces her weapon’s power reducing her weapon’s damage
            to zero. She does gain one bonus die for any point of Armour Piercing above her opponents Armour
            rating.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Burning (Fuoco ••)</b><br>
            The Princess’ weapon erupts into flame. If she applies Fuoco to an attack, it gains the 9-again quality
            and if the target is as flammable as dry wood it will likely catch fire.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Knockout (Terra ••)</b><br>
            Strikes with the Princess’ weapon have the force of avalanches. If the Princess applies Terra to an
            attack, the attack gains the Stun quality: the target’s Size is halved for the purpose of applying the
            Stunned Tilt (GMC 212)</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Soothing (Legno ••)</b><br>
            If the Princess applies Legno to an attack, and a target takes damage from it, a dose of an opiate
            enters his bloodstream, and he must roll his Stamina + Resolve - the Princess’ Legno. If he fails, he
            suffers the Drugged Tilt. The magic ensures there are no after effects and no possibility of an allergic
            reaction.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Draining (Lacrima ••)</b><br>
            The Princess’ weapon draws shadows to itself, unsettling anyone with the bad luck to touch it. If she
            applies Lacrima to an attack, and the target takes damage from the attack, he must roll Resolve +
            Composure, and loses 1 point of Willpower if he fails. Using this upgrade is a Compromise at Belief
            6+ with a -1 modifer.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Berserk (Tempesta ••)</b><br>
            The Princess’ weapon’s blows come so furiously that they catch their targets by surprise. If she makes
            an all-out attack with the weapon and applies Tempesta to the attack, she doesn’t get the normal +2
            bonus; instead she subtracts her Defence from the target’s Defence (to a minimum of zero). If they
            are enhancing their defence through Supernatural means, a Clash of Wills ensures.</p></div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Javelot (Fight •)</button>
<div class="content">
    <p><b>Action:</b> Permanent<br>
    </p>
    <p>A thrown weapon becomes part of the Princess’ Regalia, delivering the her will to harm from afar.
        Compared to Levinbolt Javelot lacks raw damaging power but presents a verity of useful tactical options.
        It can appear as nearly anything: A deck of playing cards, shuriken, seeds that grow into weapons during
        flight. Regardless of the weapon’s form it is an aerodynamic weapon and the Princess uses the Athletics
        skill to throw it. Initially the weapon’s Damage is 1 but this may be increased with Upgrades. When the
        Princess attacks she may apply an Invocation to increase her accuracy, but not her weapon’s Damage.
        Invocations must be applied before dice are rolled.</p>
    <p>The weapon’s damage can be either Bashing or Lethal and the Princess can swap between them
        with a Transformation action. The weapon always has a Size between 1 and 4. For anyone but the
        Princess, the Initiative penalty and the minimum Strength needed to use the weapon both equal three
        + the Princess’ Inner Light For the Princess herself, both are 0 - as an extension of her will, the weapon
        obeys her desires as well as her own hands. Generally a Javelot cannot be caught by anyone except the
        Princess, or a character with enough Armour to catch the knife by the blade as it were.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Accurate</b><br>
        Stacks, up to 3<br>
        The Princess wields her weapon with supernatural skill. Each time the Princess takes this upgrade,
        she gains 1 bonus die when attacking with her weapon.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Damaging</b><br>
        Stacks, up to 2<br>
        Each time the Princess takes this upgrade, she adds 1 to her weapon’s Damage.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Spread</b><br>
        Stacks, up to 2<br>
        The Princess weapon comes in bulk, or bounces between her foes. She may spend a Wisp to perform
        a short burst of autofire. With two purchases spending 1 Wisp allows the Noble to fire three short
        bursts or one medium burst.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Breaking (Aria ••)</b><br>
        The Princess’ weapon strikes the most vulnerable points. For the purposes of calculating whether an
        attack Inflicts a Tilt it’s Damage is considered to be Aria points higher.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Beacon (Acqua ••)</b><br>
        The Princess’ weapon remains in her target and glows like a beacon. The next mundane attack
        (including Kensai, Levinbolt, and Javelot) takes a bonus equal to the lower of her Successes and her
        dots in Acqua. After Acqua turns the bonus is wasted.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Revealing (Legno ••)</b><br>
        The Princess’ weapon remains in her target and beings to telegraph it’s attack, warning anyone nearby
        of his intentions. The target’s next action which directly harms someone takes a penalty equal to the
        lower of the Princess’ Successes and her dots in Legno. After the target’s next action, regardless of
        what action he takes, the effect ends.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Draining (Lacrima ••)</b><br>
        The weapon drains the will of the target if it strikes home. If the Princess applies Lacrima to an attack,
        and the target takes damage, he also loses 1 point of Willpower. Using this upgrade is a Compromise
        at Belief 5+ with a -2 modifier.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Trickshot (Specchio ••)</b><br>
        The Princess’s throws her weapon in an impossible shot. She might aim over her shoulder with a
        mirror, ricochet the blade several times to her target or curve a boomerang around several corners.
        She ignores up to her Specchio in penalties for long range, called shots, concealment and other similar
        modifiers.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Levinbolt (Fight •)</button>
<div class="content">
    <p><b>Action:</b> Permanent<br>
    </p>
    <p>A ranged weapon becomes part of the Princess’ Regalia, delivering the her will to harm from afar. It can
        appear as nearly anything: wizards’ staffs, futuristic pistols, wands of ice. Even weapons that shouldn’t
        function at long range, such as arbitrarily long spears and thrown daggers that fly like a rifle shot can
        function as a Levinbolt. Regardless of the weapon’s form, the Princess uses the Firearms Skill to attack
        with the weapon. Initially the weapon’s Damage is 2 but when she attacks the Princess may apply an
        Invocation to add Damage or to boost her weapon’s accuracy, adding her dots in the Invocation to her
        dice pool, this stacks with any damage or bonus dice from Upgrades. Invocations must be applied before
        dice are rolled. The princess may not apply an Invocation to both Damage and accuracy in a single turn,
        she may apply two different Invocations to gain both benefits unless she is using an Invoked Upgrade.</p>
    <p>The weapon’s range is (20/40/80) * Inner Light in yards. The damage can be either Bashing or
        Lethal and the Princess can swap between them with a Transformation action. The weapon always has
        a Size between 1 and 4 but for rules purposes it is treated as size one; A Princess’ magical weapon is
        never unwieldy in close quarters. For anyone but the Princess, the Initiative penalty and the minimum
        Strength needed to use the weapon both equal three + the Princess’ Inner Light For the Princess herself,
        both are 0. As an extension of her emotions, the weapon obeys her desires as well as her own hands.</p>
    <p>Normally attacking with her Levinbolt weapon requires no Wisps, but a Princess can spend a Wisp
        to make a short burst of Autofire.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Accurate</b><br>
        Stacks, up to 3<br>
        The Princess wields her weapon with supernatural skill. Each time the Princess takes this upgrade,

        she gains 1 bonus die when attacking with her weapon.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Damaging</b><br>
        When the Princess takes this upgrade she adds 1 to her weapon’s Damage.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Spread</b><br>
        Stacks, up to 2<br>
        The Noble’s weapon allows automatic fire. With one purchase, spending 1 Wisp allows the Noble to
        fire three short bursts or one medium burst. A second purchase lets her fire short bursts at no cost,
        and spending a Wisp lets her fire two medium bursts or one long burst. As with mundane firearms,
        one turn of covering fire is equivalent to one medium burst.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Forceful (Acqua ••)</b><br>
        In addition to taking damage from the weapon’s shot, a target is pushed away. If the Princess applies
        Acqua to an attack, for each success, the target must succeed on a Stamina + Athletics - Acqua roll
        or move half the Princess’ Speed away from her, unless pushed into an obstacle. Targets that hit an
        obstacle are crushed against it, and take extra bashing damage. Roll 1 die for each success, minus 1
        for each step of Speed/2 the target moved before impact (rounding up); the target takes 1 bashing
        damage for each success on this roll.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Penetrating (Aria ••)</b><br>
        The weapon’s shot guides itself around obstacles and penetrates protective clothing. If the Princess
        applies Aria to an attack, she gains Armour Piercing equal to her weapon’s Damage + Aria, however
        this significantly reduces her weapon’s power reducing her weapon’s damage to zero. She does gain
        one bonus die for any point of Armour Piercing above her opponents Armour rating.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Burning (Fuoco ••)</b><br>
        The Princess’ weapon erupts into flame. If she applies Fuoco to an attack, it gains the 9-again quality
        and if the target is as flammable as dry wood it will likely catch fire.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Soothing (Legno ••)</b><br>
        If the Princess applies Legno to an attack, and a target takes damage from it, a dose of an opiate
        enters his bloodstream, and he must roll his Stamina + Resolve - the Princess’ Legno. If he fails, he
        suffers the Drugged Tilt. The magic ensures there are no after effects and no possibility of an allergic
        reaction.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Quaking (Terra ••)</b><br>
        If the Princess applies applies Terra to an attack, the earth bucks under the target’s feet as the
        weapon’s shot strikes him. In addition to taking damage, the target must succeed on a reflexive roll
        of Dexterity + Athletics, penalized by -1 per success, or take the Knocked Down Tilt.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Dimming (Lacrima ••)</b><br>
        The weapon’s shot assaults the will of the target if it strikes home. If the attack hits a target with
        a Wisp pool (not including Bequests) they loose one Wisp. Using this upgrade is a Compromise at
        Belief 6+ with a -1 modifier.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Irradiating (Tempesta ••)</b><br>
        The Princess may increase the Damage of the weapon’s shot by inflicting resistant damage on herself.
        1 level of bashing damage gives a +1 bonus, and 1 level of lethal damage gives a +3 bonus. The
        Princess chooses whether to take bashing or lethal damage for each attack.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Trickshot (Specchio ••)</b><br>
        The Princess’s weapon fires a bolt of pure light in an impossible shot. She might aim over her shoulder
        with a mirror, ricochet the bolt several times to her target or shoot a target 100 foot away from the
        hip. She ignores up to her Specchio in penalties for long range, called shots, concealment and other

    <p>A smile and pleasant voice disarms a Princess’ attackers, or a calculated remark at the right moment
        throws them off-balance. When the Princess takes a Dodge action, she may choose to roll Manipulation
        + Persuasion or Intimidation instead of rolling double her defence. Unfortunately, social acumen doesn’t
        do anything to inhuman foes; against an animal, a spirit and similar beings the Princess’ Defence remains
        at its base value, even when she dodges.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Instinctive</b><br>
        Using social talent to evade injury becomes almost a reflex. When the Princess transforms, she may
        choose to use her Manipulation + Persuasion or Intimidation instead of Wits, Dexterity and Athletics
        when calculating Defence, again this only applies against attackers with a basically human mind. The
        drawback, as before, is that against inhuman attackers she has no Defence without dodging. She may

        to activate the Charm for a turn, from that point onwards she forms the lynchpin of her team’s defence.
        When one of her companions within Inner Light yards is attacked she may shout a warning, direct a
        fighter to their ally’s aid or parry the blow herself.</p>
    <p>To do this the Princess nominates a defender who must also be within Inner Light yards (the Princess
        herself may be either the target of an attack or the defender but no one person can serve both rolls) and
        rolls her Presence + the defender’s Brawl or Weaponry.</p>
    <div class="failsucc">
        <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Noble’s clumsy move exposes her to attack without helping her ally. Her
        Defence takes a -2 penalty during the current turn.<br>
        <i>Failure:</i> The Noble’s parry is not effective.<br>
        <i>Success:</i> ach activation success reduces the damage from the attack on its target by 1, to a minimum
        of 0.<br>
        <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Noble’s parry confounds the attack so much that its target doesn’t notice
        it. The ally’s Defence is not reduced by the countered attack.

        had been attacked. If they have sacraficed their defence this turn they cannot serve as a defender.</p>

        is not real; it vanishes when the Charm ends as if it were healed, and if the target takes real damage
        when the track is full, that damage replaces the phantom damage instead of wrapping over. Phantom
        damage also has no effect if the target has no empty Health Boxes to fill. The phantom damage can
        also be healed magically, or mitigated as it’s inflicted by targets who have that ability. Phantom

    <p><b>Upgrade: Arena of the Gods</b><br>
        <b>Cost: </b> +1 Wisp<br>
        When the Princess and her opponent close into melee range a ring of fire springs up around them. This
        ring has a radius of 10 feet, and though the flames are only three foot tall they will burn anyone up to
        ten feet in the air. If there is insufficient space the arena will shrink to accommodate it’s limitations,
        and it will never form if anyone but the Princess and her opponent would be inside the ring. It may,
        however, start small and grow out, pushing others away to give the champions room.
    </p>
    <p>The flames have the size of a bonfire and the heat of a bunson burner (WoD core p180), and can be
        treated as normal flames except that they never ignite anything else and cannot be extinguished by
        non-magical means.</p>
    <p><b>Drawback: </b>Obviously enough, by invoking this Charm the Princess has cut off her escape with a big
        wall of fire. This can by mitigated with charms like Barrier Jacket, but in a formal dual it is considered
        cheating to exit the arena.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Radiant Victory</b><br>

    <p>The World of Darkness is full of strange and weird monsters, and sometimes a Princess’ magic isn’t
        the right tool for the job. By taking a sample, at least the size of a bullet, of any mundane physical
        material the Princess may load it into her Levinbolt or Kensai weapon. For the remainder of the scene
        attacks with the enhanced weapon count as both the loaded material and magic and should be treated
        appropriately when compared to a supernatural (or natural) weakness and when up against defences

    <p>For the purposes of this Charm “fighting an opponent” is defined as attacking that opponent, using a
        Charm upon that opponent, taking an action designed to prevent the opponent’s action from succeeding,
        or assisting one of her allies in doing any of the aforementioned actions.</p>
    <p>The designated opponent must be the primary target of the Princesses action. If one Darkspawn plans
        to use a trick which removes Defence so that the Princesses designated target can attack a defenceless
        foe; then preventing the first Darkspawn’s action will not qualify. The Princess can still do so but it will

    <p>A net of brambles, grasping vines, iron hard cloth, or some other magic forms in the Noble’s hands, and
        she throws it at a target [CofD 90]; the net is not aerodynamic. If she succeeds, she entangles the target

        If the target Breaks Free, or the Noble takes any action other than maintaining the grapple, the Charm
        ends. Essentially the Princess rolls to throw a net using the usual rules, and if she succeeded she may

    <p>The greatest victory is the battle won without violence, and magic is good at sharing victory with all.
        By calling upon the Matron of the Forests a Princess can snatch the weapons from her foes hands, but
        she cannot do it without taking violence from her friends as well.</p>
    <p>This Charm spreads the Anti-War Zone tilt to the surrounding environment, applying a penalty to
        all combat rolls equal to the successes rolled.</p>

    <p>The Princess conjures a ball that explodes in a gout of consuming fire. The ball is an aerodynamic object
        of Size 1, and is thrown normally for such objects; when it hits, it explodes with a blast area equal to
        the Princess’ Inner Light and a Damage equal to her successes. The explosive is also an incendiary –
        anything damaged by it ignites, and while the direct explosive damage is bashing, damage from fires set
        by it is lethal. All such fires are mundane, though the explosive is not. The Princess may hold the ball
        up to her Fuoco in turns, after which it explodes wherever it is.</p>

    <div class="failsucc">
        <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess is overcome with a feeling of utter futility and defeatism. She loses all

        <i>Failure:</i> The Princess cannot focus.<br>

        continue fighting long after her body has been utterly destroyed (she would resemble an unusually
        solid Goalenu at this point).<br>
        <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Princess develops such as strong aura of violence and power that her foes flee
        at the very sight of her. She also gains the Terrifying tilt, the people affected are Mortals (including
        minor templates like Sworn and Darkened) and Darkspawn.

        <p>The Princess blesses the ground she stands on, and dedicates it temporarily to her Queen and the Light.
            By using this Charm a Princess applies the Consecrated condition to the area until the Charm ends.
            Many Charms, distinguished as such in their description are more durable or effective when invoked
            upon consecrated groups. The Princess needs to cleanse and purify every part of the area she wishes
            to sanctify; this can be as simple as giving it a thorough spring cleaning, or it can be an elaborate rite
            for casting out evil spirits, depending on the Princess’ cultural background. However, if she applies an
            Invocation, the method of purification invokes the relevant Queen and must use symbols appropriate for
            her.</p>
        <p>Consecrating a large area is naturally harder than a small one, Consecrate is a Sanctuary based
            Charm.</p>
        <div class="failsucc">
            <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess ruins the area’s blessing - all her accumulated successes are lost, and
            if the area has the Consecrated condition immediately loses it. No one can use Consecrate there for a
            full month.<br>
            <i>Failure:</i> The Princess makes no progress, but may continue her efforts.<br>
            <i>Success:</i> The Princess progresses in her work. When she reaches the threshold, the area gains the
            Consecrated condition and retains it for 1 day. The Princess may continue working to extend the
            Charm’s duration:<br>
            2 * Sanctuary Size = 1 day<br>
            4 * Sanctuary Size = 1 week<br>
            6 * Sanctuary Size = 1 month<br>
            8 * Sanctuary Size = 1 year<br>
            10 * Sanctuary Size = indefinite<br>
            <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The Princess makes great progress.
        </div>
        <p>If an area is already Consecrated, Consecrate will not take effect until the Princess reaches enough
            successes to exceed the remaining duration of the previous Consecration. (For instance, if an area will
            be Consecrated for five days, the Princess must reach enough successes for a week’s duration, after which
            the area will be Consecrated for a week.) If any part of an area is Tainted, the Charm automatically
            fails. Consecrate ends if the area suffers major alterations or damage, or someone manages to bring Taint
            into it.</p>
        <p>If the Princess has access to gems created by the Charm Enduring Beauty she can use them to
            empower Consecrated ground, extending the duration of the protection. A gem worth Resources three
            increases the duration by one step (so 2 * the area’s size successes creates a duration of 1 week). A
            gem worth Resources five increases the duration by two steps. It takes five gems worth Resources one to
            increase the duration by one step. Multiple gems may be combined for a greater effect but the required
            successes can can never drop below 2 * the area’s size. Naturally the duration cannot be increased past
            indefinite.</p>
        <p>Gems used to empower Consecrated Ground must be reworked into part of the ground, becoming
            beautiful statues, stained glass windows or other features. This happens as part of the Charm. They
            must be displayed prominently but can be protected by any anti-theft measure that doesn’t spoil their
            beauty. If even one of these reworked gems is removed from the Consecrated ground the Charm ends.
            Once the gems are transformed happens they can never again be used to enhance magic, however they
            are still beautiful and may be worth money as works of art, and they can still be used to return beauty
            to whomever it was taken from.</p>
        <p>Making use of Consecrated ground that is built on stolen beauty is a Belief Compromise, unless
            there is good evidence to suggest that the beauty was taken consensually. There is no modifier for the
            Compromise roll.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Purifying</b><br>
            The Princess may apply the Consecrated condition on top of Taint. The Taint will always overcome
            this Charm given enough time, but it can allow the Princess some vital breathing space. Invoke
            Consecrate like normal, but increase the required Successes by the Taint’s Severity then:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>The Taints’ Curses go dormant.</li>
            <li>The Taint will not attempt to Corrupt nor will it affect characters with sensitivity.</li>
            <li>The Taint no longer provides access to and from the Dark World.</li>
            <li>The Taint remains vulnerable to any technique that might purify it.</li>
        </ul>
        However once per day reduce the Princesses Successes by the Taint’s Severity. When her Successes
        are reduced to zero or when the duration expires, as measured by her unmodified Successes, the
        Consecrated condition ends and the normal effects of Taint return. The Princess may invoke Consecrate
        again to add additional Successes, but this only delays the inevitable.</p>
        <p>Purifying only protects against the existing Taint, new Taint will end the effects.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Bastion</b><br>
            Several charms have special benefits when cast upon Consecrated ground. When Consecrate is invoked
            with Bastion another benefit is added: Charms that benefit from the Consecrated condition are immune
            to being dispelled (such as by the Charm Unweaving) for as long as the condition remains.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that Consecrate itself can be dispelled and this Upgrade offers no protection
            against that.</p>

    <p>The Princess gains the benefits of the Unseen Sense merit for all supernatural phenomena within 10 x
        Inner Light yards. Any being with a Rank or Supernatural Advantage trait will trigger her sense upon
        stepping within Inner Light x 10 yards of the Princess, and any active use of their powers will trigger
        her sense again. A Mortal with Supernatural Merits or a template that doesn’t grant a Supernatural
        Advantage (such as Sworn) will not trigger her sense, but active use of their abilities will do so.</p>
    <p>The Princess may roll Wits + Empathy reflexively when her sense is triggered, and may apply an
        Invocation to this roll. If she sensed something of the Light or the Darkness, success identifies the power
        as of the Light or the Darkness. For other powers the Princess must learn about the nature of the power
        through research or investigation. So if a Princess felt a power belonging to a Vampire she could tell
        that it was the same kind of power as every other use of a Vampire’s power she previously felt. But she
        would not know that all these powers belonged to Vampires without investigating.</p>
    <p>If the character using the power has the ability to conceal itself from supernatural detection, then
        the Princess must overcome that concealment as per the usual rules.</p>

            By spending an additional Wisp, the Princess shifts her flesh partly into Twilight, allowing her to touch

            and armour) are carried into this state with her, as are the effects of Charms. If the Princess has Spirit
            Sight or Second Sight she may choose any combination of Dreamlanders, Spirits or Ghosts (along with
            their related phenomina) to apply Touching too when she activates the Charm.</p>

    <p>The Princess may transfer some of her own Wisps to to another. She and the target must be physically
        near to each other, as a rule of thumb they need to be within shouting distance, and the Princess must
        be able to create an emotional reaction, no matter how small. Once both conditions are satisfied the
        Princess wills her magic to travel and it does so, in a glowing, sparkling bolt of energy, filling the target’s
        emotional reaction with magical power.</p>
    <p>The Princess can also transfer Wisps into an object, providing it has a Wisp Pool. This is harder,
        and requires the Princess to touch the target object.</p>
    <p>Transferring a Wisp through Charge counts as spending a Wisp when measuring against a Princess’
        Wisp per turn limit, and she cannot give more Wisps than the target can hold.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Accepted</b><br>
        The Princess may take Wisps from other people, if they are willing to give them. If the target consents,
        the Princess may use this charm in reverse to draw wisps into herself. Inanimate objects like Bequests
        are obviously unable to give consent to anything.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Distant</b><br>

        The Princess may use the Charm on people who are not present. She spends a Wisp and rolls Presence
        + Empathy - Intimacy, and may apply an Invocation to the roll. If she succeeds she creates a magical
        link through which she can transfer Wisps, this link lasts for a scene. If the Princess has Accepted,
        she can take Wisps through this link as well.

        converted Wisps into Essence before offering it to a Dramlander, and transform any Essence received
        into Wisps.</p>
    <p>As there are an awful lot of Dreamlanders with Essence pools and loyalty to a Queen and her Court
        the Storyteller should be careful not to let the Dreamlands become an infinite source of free Wisps.
        Running low on Wisps is one of the ways Princess: the Hopeful can give mechanical heft to the
        Mood of Exhaustion. But at the same time, when it’s dramatically appropriate one good night’s sleep
        recharging the player characters can be a big part of portraying exhaustion. Use your judgement and

    <p>Mortals may not be magical, but they can use magic. Some forms of magic used by mortals are impossible
        for a Princess to perform, others are rendered obsolete, and then there are some types of magic that
        Princesses find come even easier after they Blossom.</p>
    <p>On the whole Princesses aren’t that great at working with or against Ephemeral Beings (Dreamlanders
        excepted). The noble magic that affects such beings tends to be basic, with only obscure Embassies
        mastering anything substantial. Ghosts are easier to work with but to learn Charms that affect Ghosts
        she would have to first become a practitioner of Lacrima, even though Lacrima’s Ghost Charms do not
        compromise Belief few among the Radiant are willing to take that step.</p>
    <p>So if Princesses want to deal with an Ephemeral Being they’ll either call the Embassy, or they’ll turn

    <p>The Light exists within the world, within the hearts of all men. However, with will and effort, the
        Hopeful may calcify Wisps into gem-sized, imperishable Seeds, proof against the ravages of chance. Each
        Wisp spent on the Charm forms a separate Seed. The Princess does not have to decide how many Seeds
        to calcify beforehand; after spending the Willpower, she starts to concentrate on her pool of Wisps. Each
        three successes accumulated allows the Princess to transform one Wisp into a Seed, and she may roll a
        number of times equal to her dice pool, or until she runs out of Wisps. Extra successes are wasted.</p>
    <p>The shape of a Seed is a profound expression of its creator’s soul, and is heavily influenced by the
        Invocation (if any) applied in its making. (Applying Legno, for instance, often creates Seeds in the form
        of living, unchanging flowers.) Any character examining a Seed, if they make a Wits + Occult roll, can
        recognize a Seed as coming from the same hand as one they’ve seen before (Invocations are usually clear
        without a roll).</p>
    <p>To recover the Wisp from a Seed, a character must bring it into contact with their phylactery, and
        spend a minute in concentration. No actions may be performed while doing this, and the character is at
        -3 to all Wits-based rolls, so deep is their focus. The Seed glows, and becomes incohesive, melting into
        their soul, and adding the Wisp to their pool. If the character’s Wisp pool is full, the Seed vaporizes
        and releases the Wisp into the air, where it dissipates.</p>
    <p>As tiny fragments of solidified Light, Seeds are incredibly alluring to creatures of the Darkness. Any
        character with the Darkened template can consume Seeds to regain Willpower, gaining one point of
        Willpower per Seed eaten. The Darkened can smell out Seeds kept in quantity - they gain a cumulative
        +1 bonus to all Perception rolls to notice a person carrying Seeds for each Seed above the carrier’s
        Composure, and tend to aim first at opponents carrying the most Seeds. Moreover, any location where
        large numbers of Seeds are stored can be noticed for miles. For this reason, Alhambran outposts tend
        to either be very heavily protected, or to try to move their ill gotten gains back to their rain-soaked city
        as fast as possible. And for the same reason, servants of the Queen of Storms have been known to use
        captured Seeds as Darkspawn bait.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Bereaved (Lacrima •••)</b><br>
        The production of Seeds by Alhambrans occurs on an industrial scale. Reduce the time per roll to
        once per turn.</p>
    <p>As a side effect of applying this Upgrade, the character removes the unique traces of their identity
        from the Seeds they make. Instead, the Seed forms as one of the seals of the Kingdom, the crown
        of the Queen of Tears prominent on it. The production of such a Seed is frequently used as a test
        of identity by an Alhambran outpost sent a new Noble, and documents and packages sent between
        groups are sealed with wax imprinted with this mark. This leaves unmistakable magical traces, which
        a character with Lacrima 1 or higher, or the ability to see auras, can detect with a Wits + Occult roll,
        making forging the seal harder.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Militant (Tempesta •• or Fuoco •••)</b><br>
        One cannot simply wait for the Light to diffuse into one’s soul! All of existence is a war against the
        Darkness, and no soldier of the Seraphic General should be caught without her arms! When creating the Seed, the Noble may choose to make it release its energy quickly. If Tempesta was applied, the
        Wisp can be recovered from the Seed as a reflexive action, at a cost of 1 resistant Bashing damage,
        with no more than skin contact with the Seed. There is no limit to how many Seeds can be tapped in
        this way per round, beyond the limits of one’s well-being.</p>
    <p>The followers of the Queen of Swords are less rash, but no less aware of the dangers of the world. By
        applying Fuoco, they create Seeds that release their Wisp as an instant action.</p>

    <p>A Princess is as much a being of mortality as she is of the Light. Just as the Transformation allows
        her to switch between these worlds she may push these changes outwards, creating a safe space through
        which magic cannot enter. The Charm is used on an enclosed space, such as a building or a fenced park
        - if the Princess needs to protect an area that isn’t enclosed, she must mark its border somehow, by (for
        instance) drawing a chalk line or throwing down a rope. The area must not extend more than (Inner
        Light x 20) yards in any direction, unless the area is Consecrated.</p>

        <i>Success:</i> The Princess applies the Warded condition to the target area for one scene; any attempt to

        Clash of Wills dicepool at the point this Charm was invoked, and the Princess is aware of any such
        attempts. If this Charm was invoked as a teamwork action the Primary Actor’s Clash of Wills dicepool
        is used, but all participants are aware of any attempts to breach the Wards. If the enclosed space has
        the Consecrated Condition, the Charm lasts until the area is no longer Consecrated and the Warded

    <p>In her Transformed identity a Princess is an inherently magical being. Her shining heart is comprised
        of both muscle tissue and solid magic, her fingers are made of flesh and clever little enchantments, her
        eyes, those are magic too. By spending a Wisp the Princess can see (or smell, or taste or somehow
        sense) magic. This includes both magical beings, magical items or places, and the presence of lasting
        magical enchantments. This sense extends as far as she can see with her eyes and can be enhanced with
        binoculars, a telescope or remote vision Charms, but not over a television or camera.</p>
    <p>By rolling Intelligence + Empathy (for a Princess’ magic), Science (for a mad scientist’s work), or
        Occult (for anything else) the Princess can also determine what kind of magic she is looking at. She may
        apply an Invocation to this roll. However the Princess cannot see in any detail. At best she might get
        something like “it looks angry” when looking at a werewolf or a werewolf’s spell. If the Princess sees the
        same kind of magic again she can recognise the similarity; to the normal limits of her memory. If the
        Princess learns that the angry looking person is a werewolf she can conclude that all the other people or
        enchantments with the same angry look are also werewolves or their creations.</p>
    <p>If she is looking at an active magic effect or magical item she can determine its purpose to a similar
        level of detail, such as “protect this building”. If the Princess has the Reflected Light upgrades Light
        Attuned or Dark Attuned she gains their benefits when using Magical Girl’s Eyes, if she has Study
        Inheritance then she only needs to look at a Bequest to learn it’s particulars. As with all uses of vision
        this power is less effective over distance, as a rule of thumb the Princess’s ability to analyse magic fades
        with distance at the same rate as her ability to recognise faces.</p>
    <p>This Charm provides no ability to see into Twilight, though if the Princess has some other means of
        seeing into Twilight it will apply to it’s full extent upon the residents of that plane. If the enchantment
        itself is constructed to be hidden from poking and prying, or if the enchantment conceals things such as
        by making them invisible the Princess may roll a Clash of Wills to overcome such deceptions.</p>

    <p>Every Princess can bind herself to a Shikigami, but some Princesses know other ways to invite

        The Princess can bind Dreamlanders into physical vessels, allowing them to affect the physical world
        without worrying about Manifestations for the duration of the Charm. Mechanically this can be
        treated as a Shikigami without a bond to any Princess (unless they acquire one later of course). At
        the cost of a Willpower Dot the Shikigami binding can be made to last Indefinitely, allowing the
        Shikigami to remain on Earth without a Noble’s support or the need to use Manifestations upon a
        living being. Shikigami who receive this boon may travel too and from the Dreamlands in their sleep
        and may form and break the Shikigami bond with Nobles without risking their new body.

    <p><b>Upgrade: Dreaming Exile (Specchio ••)</b><br>
        <b>Cost: </b> +1 Wisp and 1 Willpower<br>
        The Noble can bind a Dreamlander into the body of a human. In essence she grants the Dramlander
        one use of the Greater Possession Manifestation (identical to Possession, save that it’s duration is
        indefinite) on a target of her choosing. This allows the Dreamlander to bypass the need for any
        Manifestation Conditions.
    </p>
    <p>If the Princess is in the Dreamlands she can use this to give herself (or another Dreaming Princess)
        access to the Greater Possession Manifestation, but she will need to use the Charm Ivory Gate along
        with Dream of Me to target a physical body while in the Dreamlands. In short, she must use the same
        methods as an Amanojaku.</p>

    <p>The Princess binds the form of a Charm into a physical vessel, creating a new Bequest. Before a
        Princess can invoke Bequeath she needs to acquire an item of power by undertaking a quest through her
        Crawlspace or the Dreamlands. When she has found the form in the Dreamlands, and has a suitable
        vessel with her sleeping body, she carries the form into her Crawlspace, and standing at the threshold
        between wakefulness and dreams begins casting Bequeath.</p>
    <p>If the Princess spends a Willpower point the Bequest will last for a Session, however if she spends a

    <p>Bequeath cannot be used by Sworn or Beacons even if it itself is crafted into a Bequest. The

        she looses access to it for the duration of the Charm. If the duration is Indefinite she immediately
        regains any experience spent upon the Charm and can learn it again by re-training herself in the

    <p>When creating a Bequest a Chosen can embed a gem created by Enduring Beauty as a source of
        power. If she does so the Bequest has an equipment bonus to its activation roll equal to the Resources
        value of the gem she used. She may trade two points of the equipment bonus to allow the Bequest to
        generate 1 Wisp per day into it’s own pool. The Charm Study Inheritance will reveal the details of a
        Bequest’s Empowerment but anyone with experience of Bequests will have little trouble figuring it out.</p>
    <p>By pressing an Empowered Bequest to the forehead of the gem’s original owner, the owner’s beauty
        may be restored; doing this destroys the Bequest beyond repair.</p>
    <p>The question that haunts many Nobles is whether using such tools is an endorsement of their creation.
        Knowingly using an Empowered Bequest, unless the Princess has reason to believe the Gem at its heart
        was created consensually, is a Belief compromise. There is no modifier to the roll.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Charged</b><br>
        The new Bequest carries a pool of 10 Wisps, which is initially empty. The Princess must define a duty
        the Bequest’s owner can fulfill to fill its pool. Note that this adds a dot to the Bequest’s Merit rating,

    <p>The Princess imbues an object with the power to repel a type of supernatural beings.</p>
    <p>The Princess begins by choosing the type of monster she wishes to repel, she may choose any type
        of supernatural being she has encountered before or create a blanket prohibition against all Creatures of
        the Darkness, and she chooses an object to enchant. Usually Ofuda are made from a photo or small scroll
        of text symbolic to whatever it protects against. Then she rolls to create the Ofuda. If she Succeeds she
        bestows the Ofuda Condition on the object: It will repel any of the target being within 2x Inner Light
        Yards unless they succeed on a Resolve + Supernatural Tolerance - the Ofuda’s strength roll. Chance
        dice are automatic failures, meaning that a Strength of 20, if a Princess could manage it, will provide
        absolute protection against anything less powerful than a Queen.</p>
    <p>If there is already an Ofuda in place the Princess may cast additional invocations of this Charm into
        the same object to expand the Charm’s affects to more kinds of supernatural beings; if she does so she
        only needs four successes.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Exemption</b><br>
        The Princess may allow a number of trusted individuals, up to her Inner Light, to bypass her
        protections. Alternately, by adding Commonalty to the roll she may allow a social group to enter
        unbarred. The Princess may change who is permitted and who is not after the Ofuda is created by
        casting Ofuda again while touching the imbued Item. This will not change the strength of the
        defences.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Sanctuary</b><br>
        The Princess may intertwine an Ofuda with Consecrated ground. This both extends its range to
        cover the entire Consecrated area and extends the duration until the area no longer possesses the
        Consecrated Condition or until the imbued object is destroyed.<br>
        An Ofuda invoked with Sanctuary must be built into the physical structure of the Consecrated ground
        it protects, even if only by nailing it to a wall. If it is removed from the Consecrated ground the

    <p>Many magical abilities, such as the Charm Royal Witness, bind people into magical contracts. And

    <p>With this Charm the Princess may modify the terms of a magically binding contract but must remain
        within the spirit of the original. If the contract specifies that a cleaner will clean a house every day in
        exchange for money the Princess could modify the contract to allow the cleaner to take time of for illness
        in exchange for reduced pay, or allow the cleaner to subcontract. She could add a clause saying the
        cleaner cannot be hassled at work. But should could not rewrite things until the cleaner is paid for
        nothing, paid to work as a carpenter, or working for nothing.</p>
    <p>If the Princess has the consent of all parties she spends one Wisp. If one or more party is unreachable
        or unwilling to renegotiate she also spends a point of Willpower and if the unconsenting party invested
        magic into the contract the Princess must make a Clash of Wills.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Legal Limits (Terra •••)</b><br>
        A contract isn’t a licence to enforce any terms against anyone. By appealing to a higher power such
        as national law the Princess is free to make any changes that are required to bring the contract in line
        with the regulations, up to and including nullifying the entire contract. The higher power the Princess
        invokes must have clearly defined rules that govern contracts, and the Princess can only invoke a power

    <p>All humanity ultimately owes allegiance to the Kingdom-which-is-Alhambra. Though they may not
        follow their oaths, it is still possible to extract the taxes rightfully owed. Like most feudal kingdoms, in
        Alhambra land is the defining symbol of wealth and the basic tax is on property rather than income.
        Publican allows Alhambra to drain Wisps out of the very soil, but at a terrible cost.</p>
    <p>Before casting Publican the user must choose the Size of the estate they wish to tax, as per the
        Sanctuary Size scale. A success inflicts the Property Tax condition, draining Wisps from the land. At
        first the process is slow, but as Wisps come loose it becomes significantly faster. Every week the land
        produces (Size * weeks active) Wisps. On a Blessed place double the Wisps produced.</p>
    <p>The cost in Wisps is 1 + Sanctuary Size of the area affected, so barring a Blessed Place it requires at
        least two weeks for Publican to turn a profit. Alhambrans nearly always scout extensively and prepare an
        enclave to monitor and protect their efforts; Publican requires daily maintenance, this costs nothing but
        requires fifteen minutes of work by someone who knows the Charm (or has a Bequest). The Unweaving
        Charm can also stop Publican in it’s tracks.</p>
    <p>Anyone who knows the Publican Charm can also gather the Wisps it creates, they must stand
        inside the affected area and may gain up to Lacrima wisps every five minutes. Bequests containing
        Publican can refill their own pool or their user’s Wisp pool.</p>
    <p><b>Drawback: </b>Draining the Light from the land ruins it. At the end of each week roll the Wisps produced.
        A Success removes one point of Beauty or inflicts one point of Taint, what is left behind after Alhambra
        steals all which is good. Once there is at least 10 points of Taint there is little left to gain, the Condition
        ends 24 hours later and any ungathered Wisps are lost.</p>
    <p>Alhambra survives by stealing hope itself from the world, and the Curses of the Tainted place should

    <p>The Princess invokes the power of the Queen of Storms to scour away the Darkness with blood. To use
        Purgation, the character cuts herself and drips blood from the cut onto a Tainted area. As she continues
        to invoke Purgation the blood writhes and boils, channelling the endless fury of the Queen of Storms.
        When she reaches the Threshold the her blood immediately catches alight with green fire.</p>
    <p>The green fire that is created by this Charm is mostly mundane. It spreads or dies like an ordinary
        fire, it does however burn in both the Tainted Place and the Dark World beneath it. The fire created by
        Purgation begins with the size and heat of a torch, however it consumes Taint with unbridled ferocity
        and is likely to spread and grow quickly. Against creatures of the Dark or the physical structure of the
        Tainted place it burns with the heat of molten metal and the physical structure of a Tainted Place is
        treated as though it were as flammable as dry straw: Metal, asbestos, even water, if it’s part of a Tainted
        Place the fires of Purgation will burn it and leave behind nothing but ashes. Unless someone intervenes
        to stop the fire a single invocation of Purgation can destroy even the largest Tainted Place without much
        issue.</p>
    <p>If Purgation is invoked outside a Tainted Place it creates a mundane orange fire with the size and
        heat of a torch, though the size and heat may increase if the fire has a chance to spread and consume
        potent fuel. The same applies if the fire spreads beyond the borders of a Tainted Place; any flames that
        cross the border will be completely mundane orange fire. If it spreads into a second Tainted Place than
        it will not regain any supernatural properties.</p>
    <p>For the purposes of Fuoco charms Tempesta’s green fire is fire. Fuoco Charms cannot prevent
        Purgation’s green fire from loosing it’s supernatural properties when removed from a Tainted Place.</p>
    <p>the Princess is interrupted she must begin the Charm from scratch; her spilt blood bubbles and
        boils, evaporating in seconds.</p>

    <p>The Princess delays a Charm’s effects. She must touch the intended target, then use another Charm
        on him; the second Charm does not take effect immediately, instead the target gets the Held Charm
        condition for a time depending on her successes. She may choose to release the delayed Charm, allowing
        it to take effect, as an instant action at any time; if she doesn’t release it when this Charm expires, the
        delayed Charm dissipates without effect. Alternately, instead of creating a delayed Charm that she may
        release herself, the Princess may set a condition that, if met, releases it automatically, to lengthen the
        time that Charm remains suspended; the more likely the condition is to occur, the longer the suspension
        lasts.</p>
    <p>The Princess must tell the target what will happen when the suspended Charm takes effect, and if
        she sets a condition, she must tell the target what it is; but she can be as cryptic (“ When all eyes turn
        toward you, you’ll find the strength to carry on”) or as direct (“ Hey, jackass! Try stealing someone’s
        purse again, and you’re going to get set on fire!”) as she wishes. She can keep up to her Inner Light in Charms suspended at once – once she reaches that limit, she must release a Charm before she may use
        this Charm again.</p>
    <p>In addition to either method of triggering the Charm the Princess may also set a condition in which
        the Charm vanishes without activating (“ Turn yourself in to the police by midnight or you’ll be set on
        fire!”).</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Inanimate</b><br>
        The Princess can place Held Charms on things other than living beings. She could for example enchant

        in it.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Repeating</b><br>
        The Princess may declare that her Charm will activate every time the condition is met. Each activation
        beyond the first requires an additional Success on the Charm’s activation roll and requires the Princess

    </p>
    <p>To unravel magical defences, to unpick a curse upon a beloved little sister, to tear apart a hostile
        Charm flying at you. There are many reasons why a Princess might need to unweave the Charms and
        magic of another. This Charm allows her to do so. The Princess may choose to Invoke this Charm as
        an Reactive, Instant, or Extended action depending on the situation and, difficulty of the task ahead.</p>
    <p>If invoked reactively the Princess grabs hold of the unfinished magic and tries to rip it apart while
        her opponent tries to hold the magic together. In short, Unweaving lets the Princess trigger a Clash of
        Wills at any time her opponent casts a spell on a target within arms reach.</p>
    <p>An enchantment that has been completed and taken hold is tougher. Instead of a Contested Action
        the Princess must score more Successes than her opponent’s Clash of Wills dicepool. She can attempt
        to grab the magic magic and rip it apart as an Instant action, or she can delicately unweave it thread
        by thread as an Extended action.</p>
    <p>Unweaving can only be used against “magic power” abilities with a duration that lasts longer than
        a Turn. Innate abilities such as Transformation or Sensitivity are unaffected. The Princess also needs
        to be able to touch the magic, usually this means being within the affected area or within arms reach of
        the target.</p>
    <p>When used against Ephemeral Beings, such as Dreamlanders, Unweaving can be used to undo the
        effects of Influences and Numina. Unweaving cannot be used to undo Manifestations, it can remove
        Manifestatinon Conditions if they were created by an appropriate method. For example, Unweaving can
        remove the Anchor condition if was created with the Charm Resting Place, an Infleunce or a Numina.
        It could not remove the condition from a natural Anchor such as a ghost’s old bones.</p>
    <div class="failsucc">
        <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess gets her magic into a horrible tangle, and is at -2 to perform Unweaving
        for the rest of the scene.<br>
        <i>Failure:</i> The Princess makes no progress.<br>
        <i>Success:</i> Progress is made, when enough Successes are reached the target magic fall apart.<br>
        <i>Exceptional Success:</i> In addition to making great Progress, the Princess also learns some detail about
        the magic’s origin, or why this thing was enchanted. Take the Informed Condition.

    <p>Through a Ceremonial induction the Princess can invite mortals to join her Court, becoming Sworn.
        The ceremony is typically held in a relatively quiet and isolated location. This is for pragmatic reasons,
        as the process of the Charm creates a rather impressive light show. For the Sworn, the ceremony is an
        enlightening experience, no pun intended. They see the image of the Queen they have chosen to serve,
        for a moment they share in everything the Queen means to the Princess accepting their fealty, and in
        that moment they share in the Princess’ magic. When the ceremony ends a small spark of Light remains.</p>
    <p>The target must understand what he is doing, and do it voluntarily; on an unknowing or unwilling
        target, the Charm fails. It also fails on mortals steeped in villainy; the target must not have Vice-Ridden
        or be Darkened. Each Queen has a different version of this Charm, and a Princess can learn or use only
        the one for her own Queen.</p>
    <p>Note that while Accept Fealty subtracts Intimacy from it’s dicepool it cannot be performed at a
        distance, and penalty is not reduced to -0 for having line of sight. Many Princesses will gladly swear a
        mortal into their Court as a favour to Princesses who don’t know this Charm or belong to another Court
        less suitable for the Sworn-to-be, in exchange for a Bequest or a favour worth a dot of Willpower. They

        were Dethroned.</p>
    <p>The sad truth is that, much like Princesses, you can’t really kill a Dethroned. They reincarnate.
        Driving a Dethroned away or killing will normally keep it away for a very long time but for a truly

    <p>Artists among the Hopeful have can infuse the Light into their art, and make it bring forth magic.
        This Charm enchants artwork, turning into a vessel to hold and invoke another Charm. The art to be
        enchanted may be created through mundane, technological or magical means but it must be a product
        of the Princess’ creativity and it must be designed specifically to carry the chosen Charm. The art is about, means, the Charm it holds, so a wholly or partly finished work on another subject cannot carry
        the intended Charm.</p>
    <p>The Princess first chooses the Charm, Upgrades, and the precise effects (for example, which emotion
        the Charm Feel So Close will enhance) she desires. The Charm chosen must be one that affects a targeted
        individual, she cannot choose something like Levinbolt. Next the Princess creates art to express the ideas
        and emotions of the chosen charm, using the normal rules for creating equipment. The equipment bonus
        must equal the dots of the Charm the Princess wishes to cast, not counting any Upgrades. When the

        released it will affect the largest Commonality group among the present audience, within the limits of
        the dicepool penalty taken. The Condition is also renewable meaning that once the Charm is used up
        the Princess can simply invoke it upon the artwork again. Damage to the artwork ends the Condition

    <p>The Princess may add Intimacy to her roll. If she does so only then the Charm within her artwork
        will only affect the targeted person, no matter how many people appreciate it before them.</p>
    <p>At any one time a Princess may have Inner Light + Belief different works of art enhanced with Living
        Image. Artwork that has used up it’s Charm still counts towards this limit. If the Princess touches the
        art she can remove the enchantment without damaging the artwork to free up a slot.</p>
    <p>Gems created by the Specchio Charm Enduring Beauty can be used to empower art created by Living
        Image, doing so requires that the artwork revolves around a deception of the human form. As these are
        Brats, it’s often a depiction of the Princess creating the artwork.</p>
    <p>The gems embedded in the artwork cause it to constantly produce Wisps allowing the art to replenish
        it’s own Charm again and again. A gem worth Resources 3 produces 1 Wisp a day and always rolls two
        successes on it’s internal Charm. A gem worth Resources 5 produces 2 Wisps a day and rolls three
        success.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Composed</b><br>
        The Princess does not enchant art, but instructions for creating art such as sheet music or a dance
        choreography. The instructions must be for a form of art where the instructions are followed in front
        of a live audience.</p>
    <p>Creating instructions follows the usual rules for this Charm. She creates the instructions first as
        mundane equipment then invokes Living Image upon them in order to apply the Held Charm Condition
        to her instructions. The Princess does not need to write anything down or otherwise create a physical
        object, she could apply Held Charm to performers directly, creating “ equipment” through a teaching
        session. However written instructions are easier to pass between different performers.</p>
    <p>From that point on, the Charm will activate upon someone who appreciates the artwork when the
        instructions are performed, as is usual for Living Image.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Duplicated</b><br>
        While some methods of creating artwork do not lend themselves to duplication, others are the exact
        opposite. A story can be photocopied without losing any of it’s artistic value.</p>
    <p>With this upgrade a Princess can convert her artwork into vessels en mass. She could invoke Living
        Image on a computer document and start printing out copies or she could invoke Living Image on
        a bowl of cake mixture and start pouring it into individual cupcakes. Each instance of her artwork beyond the first costs one Wisp and all enchanted works must be created within the same scene. In
        addition each one must be filled with Charms independently, though at the Storyteller’s discretion the
        player may be permitted to roll only once to keep the game moving quickly.</p>
    <p>Duplicated artwork only counts as a single work towards the Princess’ maximum uses of Living Image.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Gallery</b><br>
        Stacks, up to 4<br>
        The Princess can now sustain magic in more artwork. Each time she takes this upgrade, she adds two
        to the number of Living Image activations she may have up at once.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Light Attuned</b><br>
        The Princess may specify that her artwork will only invoke Charms upon Beacons, Princesses,
        Shikigami, Sworn, or any combination of those three groups. Alternatively, she may specify that her
        artwork won’t affect the Light touched.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Remote</b><br>
        The Princess may refill her artwork with fresh Charms without being in it’s physical presence. She
        must modify her Charm activation roll by her Intimacy to the artwork itself.</p>
    <p>Remote can be combined with Duplicated, but not easily. Unless a Princess feels different emotions
        about the various copies of her artwork she will be unable to choose which copy she refills.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Dark Attuned (Tempesta •)</b><br>
        The Princess may specify that her artwork will only invoke Charms upon Creatures of the Darkness.
        She may not specify a specific kind of Dark Creature.</p>
    <p>And yes, with the right Charm it is indeed possible to create artwork that makes Darkspawn feel so
        bad they explode. After all, emotions are magic.</p>

        state (such as Spooked) can also be rendered harmless until they naturally expire but no Beats are

        during a fight, when people are keyed up and attentive, but even then the targets take -1 to their
        Defence against anyone but the Princess, and fail to notice anyone who doesn’t attack them. However,
        the Princess herself can’t avoid attention - any use of Stealth, attempts to conceal herself, or ceasing

        <p>The Princess’ computer includes it’s own software for searching the web, software that search based
            on the emotional intent behind the Princess’ questions. She may spend a Wisp, roll Acqua + the

            and ten minutes to find, read, and digest new information. Exceptionally complicated topics like
            rocket science might take significantly longer.</p>
        <p>The web crawler can only find publicly available information, but this includes information on the deep
            web. It can normally register itself for websites and even defeat basic tests that check the viewer’s
            humanity. It can’t access paid content for free, but it might ask the Princess to buy access if there’s
            no equivalent information available for free.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Fishing (Acqua ••)</b><br>
            The Princess’ computer monitors networks constantly, looking for scraps of data she might need. Once

            Acqua + the computer’s equipment bonus. For every success she may ask one short factual question
            which the local computer network may know as a reflexive action. Applicable questions include asking
            for directions or a password. The Princess does not need to ask all her questions at once, the player
            may save them for the right moment: Such as having her computer ping her with the door code when

            When the Princess is connected to the internet her computer automatically routes her connections
            through a network of proxies that inflicts a -Aria penalty to all attempts to trace her. Despite it’s
            supernatural origins this is a purely mundane countermeasure.</p>
        <p><b>Upgrade: Traceless (Aria ••)</b><br>
            By it’s very nature this magic is hidden, a rival Princess using A Magical Girl’s Eyes
            takes a -Aria penalty to spot magic rushing through an internet cable, however providing that rival
            an opportunity roll with -Aria is worse than not letting her roll at all. If the Princess connects to
            or her signal passes through a supernaturally defended computer she may trigger all sorts of alarms
            by inadvertently trying to hack the logs. In short, Traceless provides very strong protection from
            mundane tracing for an increased risk of supernatural tracing.</p>

    <p><b>Upgrade: Collective</b><br>
        <b>Cost: </b>+1 Wisp<br>
        The Princess may use the Charm on a social group, using the Commonalty modifier. The member
        with the highest Composure resists for the group.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Unwitting</b><br>
        When the Princess detects a lie, she rolls Wits + the activation successes on the Charm as a reflexive
        action. If she succeeds, she gains a hint of the truth the target is concealing; on an exceptional success,
        she learns exactly what the target knows of the subject of his lie.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Alert (Aria •)</b><br>
        When the Princess detects a lie, she gains additional insight into the liar’s motive for deception. For
        example, she could smell the difference between a lie told out of envious malice and one told out of
        fear, or tell the difference between a sleazy propagandist and a dedicated, noble spy.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Guilty (Terra •)</b><br>
        When the Princess detects a lie, the liar experiences a strong pang of guilt, and finds it far harder to
        deceive again. He gains the Cursed condition for the scene, this reduces all Subterfuge rolls by the
        Princess’ Activation Successes. Further lies in the scene do not trigger this Upgrade.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Remote (Acqua •)</b><br>
        The Princess’ sense can now function on technological communications (no Upgrade is required to
        use this Charm through Charm based magical communications), from the humble pen to real time
        video-conferencing. A Princess cannot detect truth or falsehood from any message over a month old.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Righteous (Tempesta •)</b><br>
        When the Princess detects a lie, she may punish the liar with impunity. If she attacks the liar as her
        next action, he may not apply Defence to resist the attack.</p>

        a Durability then rolls Wits + Composure, subtracting the chosen durability from her roll.</p>
    <div class="failsucc">

        <i>Success:</i> Any object with a Durability equal or lesser than the nominated durability becomes
        transparent to the Princesses eyes. She can see through it but still remains aware of it’s shape and
        general location. If she focuses her attention on an object it solidifies to her eyes, this Charm imposes
        no perception penalties. If the Princess wishes to look through several objects at once, such as a
        wardrobe and the wall behind the wardrobe, she must be able to see through their combined
        durability.<br>
        X-Ray vision provides no advantages to penetrating supernatural concealment or seeing into Twilight,
        but if the Princess has some other way of doing either it stacks with X-Ray vision.<br>

    </p>
    <p>Sometimes magic gets you good. The Enlightened are all too aware of that. Sometimes your mind can
        be wrapped in irrational fear by the Dark-Spawn hanging from the ceiling, pale-faced, sometimes the
        warrior of Storms can drive you into a frenzy, some things can pass by invisible. Princesses learn, though,
        to listen to the subtle wrongness that they get when their senses are being messed with, and it’s possible
        to stoke the radiance within, to burn away the clouds that fog the mind.</p>
    <p>Whenever the Princess’ mind is influenced or controlled by a supernatural power, the player may
        declare this Charm activates and make a Clash of Wills against whoever has influenced her mind.</p>
    <p>This Charm may only be rolled once per scene.</p>
    <div class="failsucc">
        <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Princess is so utterly fooled by the deceit that her mind is rendered susceptible
        to follow-up blows. She takes the Cursed condition, inflicting a -3 penalty to realise she is under a
        supernatural compulsion. This lasts for a day.<br>
        <i>Failure:</i> Nothing happens.<br>
        <i>Success:</i> A distorted perception wavers for a moment, showing what it conceals; an imposed emotion
        falters, revealing the Princess’ true feelings; a compulsion falls slack, and is disclosed as instilled by
        another. The Princess may spend 1 Willpower point to bypass it for that action - penalties don’t
        apply, compulsions don’t restrict her.<br>
        <i>Exceptional Success:</i> The power holding the Princess’ mind slips. During the Princess’ next turn, she
        ignores its effects on her, without spending Willpower.

        When the Princess sees through an illusion she may opt to enter a tranquil state instead of breaking
        free for a turn, the same Willpower cost applies. If the Princess chooses tranquillity she remains still, unmoving and unthinking, for Legno minutes. This is often enough for the Princess to fail at whatever
        crime she was forced to attempt.</p>
    <p>If the Princess is under an effect with a limited duration, the time she spends tranquil does count
        towards the duration.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Furious (Tempesta •••)</b><br>
        A Fury can breaks free from enchantments through the pure cleansing power of hatred. If she succeeds
        on the roll and spends a Willpower point she remains free for as many turns as she spends attacking
        someone (guns, Charms, so long as she is trying her hardest to kill it doesn’t matter how) or charging
        in the direction of someone she intends to attack. Furies have been known to go on frenzied rampages

    <p>By concentrating on her innate sensitivity, the Princess may analyse the traces of past good deeds
        that has made a place Blessed. She sits and meditates within a Blessed area, or walks slowly through
        it, considering what her Light-touched senses tell her; if she should be attacked while concentrating, the
        Charm fails and she learns nothing. If a Princess uses the Charm again on a Blessed area within a week,
        she takes a -2 penalty for each past attempt in that period.</p>

        <i>Success:</i> The Princess begins to understand the Blessed area. On reaching the threshold, the Princess
        learns either the Size and approximate boundaries of the Blessed area, or one of the Blessings it grants to those of good will within it. The Princess may continue rolling after reaching the threshold the first

        <i>Success:</i> The Princess begins to understand the Tainted area. On reaching the threshold, she discovers
        either its Size and approximate boundaries, or one of its Curses as well as the history behind that
        curse. Each time she reaches a multiple of the threshold she learns another Curse, or that there is no
        more to be learned. If the Princess learns all the Curses associated with a particular Foci she learns
        of that Foci.<br>

    </p>
    <p>With this trick a Princess of Mirrors can look into one mirror and see out another. Choose one person,
        the Princess will see out of whichever mirror gives the best viewpoint of that person. If she spends a
        second Wisp then both mirrors will show each other (this is usually used with the Upgrade I hear you
        to create magical phones). The Intimacy modifier is of course measured to the person, not the mirror.</p>
    <p>The Princess is limited by the quality of the two mirrors used, a low quality mirror that gives a bad
        reflection gives a low quality image.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: I Hear You</b><br>
        The Princess can also hear through mirrors. If a mirror gives a bad picture it also gives bad audio.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: On The Wall (Specchio •••)</b><br>
        The Princess does not have to look for a specific person, she can see out of any mirror she wishes.
        Perhaps a mirror she secretly placed overlooking that Darkspawn’s lair. The Intimacy modifier applies
        to the place she wishes to see, or the mirror she’s looking out of. Whichever gives the lower penalty.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Who’s the Fairest in the Land? (Specchio •••••)</b><br>
        <b>Cost: </b>+1 Wisp<br>
        The Princes asks a mirror a question to which the answer must be a person and cannot require
        precognition to determine. “Who murdered Miss Daisy?”, “Who snitched on me to the teachers?”
        are good examples. “How do I break into the Alhambran stronghold?”, “Who will win the student
        election?” are bad examples.</p>
    <p>The Storyteller should answer in good faith to the best of her ability by presenting a glimpse of a
        scene that answers the question. Creative interpretation of the question and other low tricks should
        only be used on a Dramatic Failure.</p>
    <p>Unlike other uses of Mirror Mirror, this upgrade does not make use of the Princess’ connection to her
        target, but draws answers directly from the tapestry of fate. This means you do not apply an Intimacy
        modifier. On the other hand you only get to watch for 1 turn per success.</p>

    <p>The Princess mentally describes an object. She becomes aware of the location of the nearest object
        matching the description within 25 yards and may increase the range by taking a penalty to the dice roll
        at a rate of 25 yards per die. Mundane concealment cannot defend against this Charm. The description
        must be phrased in terms of the object’s composition and form, not its significance or intended use. For
        example, “audiotapes”, “letters in my father’s handwriting”, and “weak places in the wall” all work;
        “incriminating evidence”, “letters about my father”, and “something that will help me escape” do not.
        A Princess can find only one object at a time; if she activates Moving Finger when she already has it
        active, the first use ends immediately.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: General</b><br>
        <b>Cost: </b> +1 Wisp<br>

        objects matching only one description at a time.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Significant (Acqua ••)</b><br>
        The Princess may describe an object by its meaning. For example, she can find documents about a
        specific subject in a wall of file cabinets, or search the scene of a murder for clues to the killer’s identity.</p>
    <p>Note: The presence of Taint, and the property of being a focus of Taint, is considered part of an
        object’s meaning, so applying Significant allows the Charm to find a Tainted area’s focus.</p>

    <p>By holding an object in her hands, the Princess is able to catch a glimpse of the emotional impressions
        left behind on it, by significant events it was used in. With one success, this Charm grants her a fleeting
        vision of the most emotionally significant event the object was involved in within the past week; each
        additional success doubles the range of time she can see into. Especially important events, such as the
        marriage proposal a ring was used for, may remain visibile years after they occurred at the Storyteller’s
        discretion. Using this Charm on a bullet might show a vision of the shooting it was used for, a painting
        may show the emotional state of the artist who created it, etcetera. The vision lasts between three and
        thirty seconds, and appears to the Princess’ eyes as if she were at the event in question – it’s up to her
        to interpret what she sees.</p>

        The vision the Princess receives includes the context of the significant event. She sees a full scene
        of events, to which the key event serves as a climax. The time it takes her to experience this scene
        is the same as the time it originally took, and while the vision lasts she enters a meditative trance,
        only vaguely aware of your immediate surroundings; she forgoes Defence until the Charm ends. If something happens
        near her, the Princess rolls Wits + Composure - 3 to end the Charm prematurely;
        if she takes damage, the Charm ends immediately.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Specific</b><br>
        The Princess can look for events other than the most significant one. In a repeated use of the Charm,
        she takes a penalty equal to the number of events she has already seen from the target object to
        see visions of an event she hasn’t seen before (-1 for the second event, -2 for the third, and so on.)
        Repeating a vision she has seen already is at no penalty, though it may require more successes if
        enough time has passed by.</p>

    <p>How does the Queen of Mirrors know who is the true heir? Simple, she can see the future. Or maybe not,
        since none of her many True Hairs fulfilled their supposed destiny. Regardless of the truth surrounding
        the Lightbringer’s mysterious Queen, it is a fact that the Invocation of Specchio unlocks powers of
        precognition beyond the dreams common to all Enlightened.</p>
    <p>To perceive the mysteries of time and space the Princess decides which question she wishes to ask,
        she has to ask about a single person’s future. “Will I be crowned the prom queen?” or “when will I next
        be attacked?” is okay. The Princess could even ask “who will next attack me” because that is part of her
        personal timeline but she could not ask “who will be the next Miss America”.</p>
    <p>The Princess doesn’t have to ask about herself, she could ask who will next attack any specific person.
        All she needs is a mirror positioned so she can see the subject of her question within.</p>
    <p>There is a modifier to the roll based on it’s temporal proximity, because of this the Storyteller should
        always roll for Reflected Portents. A smart player can learn much from just the modifier.</p>
    <div class="failsucc">
        <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> Guided by Fate, or perhaps an unwelcome hint from her own subconscious the
        Princess sees a horrifying vision. Such as the brutal murder of a close friend. Like all prophecies it’s
        not guaranteed to come true, but she still needs to make a Sensitivity roll.<br>
        <i>Failure:</i> The future remains unclear, either nothing happens or the Princess gets a completely accurate
        vision of a clear blue sky sometime in the future. Or the depths of space, or tv static.<br>
        <i>Success:</i> After a few moments the mirror fades to reveal a vision of the future. The player asks one
        question per Success which the vision will answer. Both sight and sound are provided by the mirror,
        though both are limited by the quality of the mirror. Anyone looking at the mirror (which doesn’t
        have to be the Princess, if she turns the mirror away after the Charm takes effect) can see the vision.
        Visions revealed in Reflected Portents are entirely true and accurate, but may nevertheless change for
        the future remains in flux. Strange beings move outside of Fate, time travellers occasionally change
        history, even the Princess’ vision of the future may introduce new variables into the timeline; perhaps
        allowing her to escape a horrible fate.<br>
        <i>Exceptional Success:</i> Extra Successes are their own reward.

    <p>The Princess can only invoke this Charm on the same event once per day. Additionally she cannot
        learn anything from the past or the present (defined as the current scene). If the Princess asks about
        a past or present event roll as normal. On a Success reveal that it has already happened but give no
        further details. If the question has multiple answers; such as asking who will I marry, for someone likely
        to marry many times, choose the soonest event as defined by the dicepool modifier. If there are multiple
        events within the same time period favour big and “noticeable” events.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Distant (Specchio ••••)</b><br>
        The Princess can prophecies about a distant target by adding Intimacy to the roll. She must name
        who she is targeting before rolling.</p>

        The Princess no longer needs to name a specific person to scry against. She can instead ask a freeform
        question like “where will the next Tainted Place in this town appear?”If more than one person, place
        or other fits the question then the Charm favours the lowest dicepool modifier from temporal distance.

    <p>The Noble dreams of reality, casting her mind forth to walk, invisible and untouchable, in the waking
        world. The Embassy to the Dreamlands can combine this Charm with Christopher’s Parallel Lives, but
        twisting their privilege in this way is mentally draining and requires one willpower per scene in which
        the Charm is active.</p>
    <div class="failsucc">
        <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The Noble immediately falls asleep without dreaming, and can’t be wakened by any
        normal means; magic to wake her up faces a Clash of Wills. The sleep lasts long enough to refresh her
        Willpower.<br>
        <i>Failure:</i> The Noble remains awake.<br>
        <i>Success:</i> The Noble falls into reverie similar to Dreamlands travel, but rather than pass the threshold
        of her Crawlspace her dream form remains within the real world. In this state the Noble acts as
        an ephemeral entity in Twilight Form, with the traits of her Dream Form, and in phase with other
        psychic projections, Astral beings and Dreamlanders. Thus supernatural powers that influence minds
        or Dreamlanders in Twilight work on her, but nothing material can touch or perceive her without such
        a power. The Noble may end the Charm at any time, which returns her to her body and wakes her;
        until it ends she knows nothing of her body’s condition.<br>
        The Noble’s own powers are sharply limited in her Dream Form - unless her target is another ephemeral
        entity in phase with her, she may use only those Charms that influence minds, or Charms she can
        cast through a sympathetic connection (her connection to anything she sees is Sensory) and she may
        not use Charms that require her target to perceive her. While she doesn’t suffer Essence bleed, the
        Charm expires, waking her, if she can’t stay transformed. Should her Dream Form be destroyed, the
        Noble wakes with the Soul Shocked Condition.<br>

        The Princess’ memory instantly fills with information on the things, people and places she encounters,
        arranged in the fashion she finds easiest to understand. Until the Charm ends, the Princess gains the
        Living Library Condition. She gains the equivalent of a 3 dot Libary on one topic per success and may
        make research rolls on the covered topics at a rate of 1 roll a turn. The only limitation is that the topics
        chosen must be knowledge that is available to all of humanity. The Princess is of course free to discover
        new knowledge but her starting point, her library, is common knowledge.</p>

    <p>When the Princess transforms, she moves with the grace and speed of an Olympian gymnast. She may

        Defence trait, increasing it by her Invocation dots, for an entire turn.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Swift</b><br>
        Stacks, up to 3<br>
        The Princess moves a little faster than any normal human can. She adds +1 to her Defence, Speed
        and Initiative while Transformed each time she takes this upgrade.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Danmaku Dance</b><br>
        The Princess develops a spider sense that alerts her to ranged attacks before her attacker even pulls
        the trigger, allowing her to apply her Defence to firearms attack. However this sense draws focus away
        from her usual combat awareness. Her base Defence becomes Athletics alone, but applies to both close
        combat and firearms. On top of this the Princess adds the lower of her Wits and Dexterity to her
        Defence against either close combat or firearms. She may switch where she applies the lower of her
        Wits and Dexterity with a Transformation action, or spend a Wisp to apply it to both for a turn. If
        a Princess applies an Invocation to boost her Defence it boosts both categories.</p>
    <p>Thrown weapons are treated as close combat for the purposes of which defence category they fall
        under.</p>
    <p>Dodging bullets requires room to move into, and going prone is a bad idea when your defence depends
        on maximising your mobility.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Leap of Faith</b><br>
        The very air bears the Princess up whenever she leaves the ground. When she jumps she may spend 1
        Wisp to increase her jumping distance to three feet per Success. With this magic a Princess can jump
        the same distance vertically and horizontally, and will not hurting herself so long as she does not fall
        beyond her jumping distance.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Skating (Acqua •)</b><br>
        Ice, wet floors and oily slicks and other liquids pose little risk to the Princess’ balance; indeed, her
        movements across them are uncommonly deft. When the Princess would take a negative modifier due
        to their presence she reduces all such penalties by her Acqua. Moreover, she may spend 1 Wisp to add
        her Acqua to her Speed and Initiative for a single turn, as long as she stays within the affected area.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Whirling (Aria •)</b><br>
        The Princess’ sharpens her reflexes, and enhances her ability to evade attacks. When she applies Aria
        to her defence she uses the higher of Wits and Dexterity, not the lower, as part of her Defence trait.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Leap of Air (Aria ••)</b><br>
        The very air bears the Princess up whenever she leaves the ground. When she jumps and applies Aria
        to the roll, she may spend 1 Wisp to increase her jumping distance to five feet per Success. With this
        magic a Princess can jump the same distance vertically and horizontally, and will not hurting herself
        so long as she does not fall beyond her jumping distance.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Heaving (Fuoco ••)</b><br>
        The Princess can lift and throw objects of great weight. She may apply Fuoco to her rolls to lift an
        object that exceeds her Strength limit (see p. 47 of the core book), and adds her Fuoco in yards to
        the distance she can throw an object (see p. 67.) Moreover, she can spend 1 Wisp to throw an object
        with a Size equal or greater than her Strength, but less than her Strength + Fuoco.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Gripping (Legno ••)</b><br>
        In high places, the Princess cannot put a hand or foot in the wrong place. When she is climbing
        and applies Legno, she does not lose her grip on a dramatic failure; she only loses her next action
        recovering from her mistake. Moreover, she may spend 1 Wisp when she applies Legno to a climbing
        roll to double the distance she travels on that attempt, moving 20 feet for each success.</p>

    <p>The Princess may reflexively apply an Invocation to help resist any unwanted attempts to supernaturally
        influence or read her mind or emotions. If the power is Contested the Invocation is added to the Noble’s
        dice pool. If the power is Resisted it is subtracted from the attacker’s pool. Valiant Mind has no effect
        on a Clash of Wills pool.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Glacier Mind (Acqua •)</b><br>
        The Princess automatically applies Acqua to all relevant rolls at no cost. They cannot apply any other

        Mind cannot be combined with Tranquil Mind.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Tranquil Mind (Acqua •)</b><br>
        When somebody reads the Fury’s mind, or when someone connects to the Fury’s mind in an attempt to
        control it, everything they touch is burning acidic hate. The Princess may roll Presence + Intimidation,
        and may apply Tempesta, vs Resolve + Supernatural Advantage to inflict the Shaken Condition. On
        an exceptional success she inflicts the Terrified Tilt instead as memories of the Fury’s battles reveal
        just whom they have provoked.</p>

    <p><b>Upgrade: I've Known Worse (Lacrima •••)</b><br>

        a mental power is used on her the player may declare they are using I’ve Known Worse and take the
        Depression condition. This automatically adds Lacrima Successes to a Contesting roll, or reduces the
        Successes on a Resisted roll by Lacrima (to a minimum of zero Successes). If she uses I’ve Known
        Worse the Princess cannot use any other Charm or Invocation to bolster her resistance to the mental
        power..</p>

    <p>The Princess can think about two things at once. At the same time she is carrying out normal actions,
        she may also perform an extended action to accomplish a purely mental task – one that requires no
        physical exertion, or physical tools. (For example, composing a speech, doing calculations, or solving
        a tactical problem.) She may apply Acqua to the mental task, if she has an appropriate Charm. The

    </p>
    <p>The water touches all things. Flowing and all-encompassing, it feels the shapes of objects by where it
        is not. By using Read the Waves, the Princess enjoys a reflexive knowledge of her surroundings, up to
        a range of 5x her successes in yards. This applies to 360 degrees around her. This ability is not sight,
        but an additional sense. The slight drawback, is that she can only sense her surroundings underwater or
        when submerged in some other liquid.</p>
    <p>The additional sense has a resolution of about 1/2” (2 centimeters) and the Princess knows the
        shapes, sizes, textures and positions of all objects in the area within that level of detail. It does not
        provide colour; a book appears identical whether filled with profane words or chick-lit, although in the
        former case, a Wits + Crafts roll may be permitted to identify the characteristic texture of human skin
        binding the book. The sense only works if water currents can flow between the Princess and an object;
        she can’t use it to perceive what is in an water-tight box.</p>
    <p>Her rolls to avoid being surprised by people in range of the additional sense ignore penalties from
        lack of vision – darkness, silt clouds, or just having her back turned.</p>

    <p>The Light sustains the Princess when she can find no other food. She does not require food or water until
        the Charm ends, and does not take damage from deprivation or progress towards taking such damage.
        If she applies Legno, she adds 12 hours to the Charm’s duration for each dot in Legno she has.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Airless</b><br>
        Until the Charm ends, the Princess sinks into a trance, in which she does not need to breathe. She
        also does not require food or water while entranced. She cannot move or act, but is aware of what
        happens around her, and may awaken from the trance as a reflexive action, which ends the Charm.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Immune (Legno ••)</b><br>
        The Light within the Princess’ flesh expels alien substances from it. If she applies Legno, for the

    <p>Elegance is not a pretty gown and tasteful jewellery; it’s a state of mind and the Princess knows how to
        be elegant when up to her elbows in mud. Any sensory effect that would grant her a negative situational
        modifier to social rolls is reduced by her Composure. A Princess who is covered in blood (-5) and has

    <p><b>Drawback: </b> This power does not prevent a Princess from looking bad, it merely allows her to
        overcome its effects with grace and poise. Additionally because elegance is a state of mind a Princess
        must be in the right state of mind to use this power. If she cannot justify her appearance then she
        cannot benefit from this Charm. Being covered in mud because you were searching for a missing child

    <p><b>Action:</b> Permanent<br>
    </p>
    <p>A Princess is so stunning the universe itself cannot bear to mar her exquisite form. Any sensory effect
        that would grant her a negative situational modifier to social rolls is automatically nullified if her Specchio
        is equal to or greater than the modifier. For example a Princess with Specchio 2 is sprayed with mud
        by a passing car. Since this only gives a -2 penalty it is magically prevented, not a drop of mud sticks
        to the Princess. This effect protects the Princess from humiliation on all five senses, she wont smell of
        mud, nor will her skin feel muddy to the touch.</p>
    <p><b>Drawback: </b>Only the effects on appearance are protected. A Princess with Specchio 5 might be able
        to walk through miles of raw sewage and still look and smell fresh as a daisy afterwords but she is not
        protected from catching horrible diseases.</p>

    <p>Until the Charm ends, the Noble follows the rules for vehicles when moving (CofD 98-99). Her safe
        Speed is (Inner Light + the Applied Invocation) x10. She rolls Dexterity + Athletics to keep control of
        her movements whenever a driver would roll Dexterity + Drive to control a vehicle; her Dice Modifier,
        when that applies, is -1. If the Noble collides with another object she can be the light object in the crash.
        If the Charm ends, and the Noble is moving faster than her normal running Speed, she takes bashing
        damage equal to one-tenth her current Speed and is Knocked Down (CofD 284) by the sudden stop.</p>
    <p>The Invocation of Aria embodies the principal of speed, and as this Charm massively increases a
        Noble’s maximum speed it also raises the threshold for applying Aria at no cost while it is active. The
        Princess may apply Aria for free if she is moving above her Safe Speed.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Royal Chariot</b><br>
        While running the Princess may carry others with supernatural ease, to her they become weightless.
        While they are being carried by the Princess other characters also share her protection against air
        resistance.</p>
    <p>Theoretically the Princess can carry one person per dot of Inner Light or her applied Invocation at any
        one time. In practice it’s really hard to carry more than two people of your size at a time without their
        feet dragging the ground (which is not recommended at these speeds). However there are solutions, like
        growing massive with Royal Stature, turning into an animal better suited for carrying others through
        Skinchange, or creating a very large Bequest.</p>

        balance or carry her with it. For example the Storyteller may call for Athletics actions to stay upright atop white water, though Skating reduces these penalties like normal and she may use Skating to
        travel faster while travelling upon water. The Princess may end the Charm prematurely if she wants

    </p>
    <p>The Princess is wrapped in the air’s gusty embrace, and takes to the skies as a leaf on the breeze. Her
        Speed in the air equals 5 + Strength + Dexterity + (Aria * 2). If the Princess is airborne when the
        Charm expires, she gently drifts downward until she touches a surface, and takes no damage from the
        fall. However if the Princess’ Transformation ends while she’s flying she falls.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Airline</b><br>
        While flying the Princess may carry others with supernatural ease, at her touch they become as
        weightless as the air. While they are being carried by the Princess other characters also share her
        protection against air resistance, cold, and low oxygen levels at high altitude, this applies whether the
        Princess has those abilities from Upgrades to Wings of Air or from unrelated Charms.</p>
    <p>The Princess can use Airline on up to the higher of Aria and Inner Light people at a time, she must
        be physically carrying them, though forming a human chain or having them hold onto the edge of her
        sceptre is sufficient.</p>
    <p>If somebody is falling the Princess may use Airline to catch them. If she can match their speed and
        slowly decelerate they’re fine (and would be with an unUpgraded Wings of Air) but if the Princess
        does not have the time or the knowledge of basic physics she may roll Dexterity + Athletics + Aria.
        Each success prevents one point of falling damage.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Sonic Rainbow</b><br>
        While flying the Princess may spend a Wisp to massively increase her speed, at the cost of precision.
        If she does so use the rules for Outrace the Sun while she flies. Returning to her regular flying speed
        costs nothing but the time it takes to decelerate.</p>
    <p>As with Outrace the Sun, the Princess is protected from the effects of air resistance. She is also
        protected from the Heavy Winds Tilt while flying at Sonic Rainbow speeds.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Stratospheric</b><br>
        The Princess can safely ascend to great altitudes. As long as she is outdoors and flying she can breath
        as easily as she would do at sea level is immune to temperature extremes.</p>

    <p>The Princess assumes the shape of a beast. The new shape is of one particular species of animal; her
        mundane Physical Attributes become equal to those of a normal animal of that species, while her Mental
        and Social Attributes, and her Skills, remain unchanged. The Princess’ transformed dots still apply, and
        she gains the animal’s natural abilities and attacks, and the ability to communicate with other animals
        of the species. She may also activate Charms in animal form.</p>
    <p>The Princess cannot, however, speak any human language except the Royal Tongue unless the animal
        is able to mimic human speech (like a parrot); she is unable to undertake any task that calls for hands,
        unless the animal has them (like a monkey) or capable manipulators (an octopus’ tentacles); and her
        Regalia are transformed away and unavailable. Finally, any object she picked up after transforming out
        of mundane form does not change with her.</p>
    <p>The Princess subtracts the difference between her normal Size and the animal’s Size from the
        activation roll when using the Charm. She may remain in beast form as long as she can remain
        transformed normally, and may end the Charm at any time with a standard transformation roll or by
        returning to mundane form. The bonuses or penalties for Size provided by the Charm Royal Stature do
        not apply, it is assumed that the base attributes for an animal will take into account it’s size.</p>

        The Princess may attack others by rolling Strength + Lacrima, she does Lethal damage but a successful
        attack also drains a point of Willpower. She may also speak as normal, her strange form grants a

        in perfect working order, keeping the local gremlins friendly. The Princess uses this Charm on any Size

        She must spend a few moments giving words of advice and encouragement before invoking this Charm.</p>

    <p>The Princess can call upon her hatred of the Darkness to keep herself warmed against the most
        bitter and tainted chills. The magnitude of every Taint Curse upon the Princess is reduced by half her Resolve + Tempesta (rounding down). The Fury’s Practical Magic adds to this Charm; if the Princess

        <b>Duration:</b> Indefinite
    </p>
    <p>By touching a person, the Princess ignites a flame from the warmth of their affections for another. Taking
        fire in this way does not affect the target’s emotions, just as lighting one candle from another doesn’t
        put the first candle out. The Princess must know the subject of the target’s affections when you activate
        Flame in the Heart; she can’t simply take “the person he feels most strongly for”, without knowing just
        who that is.</p>
    <p>The flame created is candle-sized (base damage of 0) and dances on the tip of the Princess’ finger;
        its colour and Intensity depend on the nature and strength of the affection. (See the table in the Fuoco
        Invocation.) Add 1 to the flame’s Intensity if the Princess gets an exceptional success. The flame may
        be sustained indefinitely if transferred to a flammable substance such as a candle wick. It will continue
        to burn without consuming its source until it is deliberately extinguished (which is as easy as snuffing
        out a non-supernatural flame of the same size) or the target dies. A Princess may maintain a number of
        these flames equal to her Inner Light, if she wants more they must feed on mundane fuel. Extinguishing
        a flame manually (to allow maintaining a new flame, for example) has no effect on the relationship that
        originated it.</p>
    <p>The Princess can use a flame at any time to set something on fire. However, its proper use is to
        preserve the relationship that inspired it. If the target’s emotions fade they can put the flame back in
        their heart by holding it against their chest (this is quite safe, don’t wear anything flammable) doing so
        grants the Fresh Impressions Condition: Their Impressions of whomever the flame represents is reset to
        what it was at the moment the flame was taken. This only lasts for a day, but that can be long enough
        to rebuild something more durable. Using a flame to reignite a relationship does not consume the flame.</p>
    <p>With a lifetime on the road Princesses of Swords can go months or years without seeing their lovers.
        Distance can dull the strongest emotions and some Princesses like to keep their feelings safe and take
        them out again for a night of passion. Others are trusted custodians of stable relationships, reigniting
        the spark after time smothers the flames.</p>
    <p>Finally, as long as the flame exists, it provides an Intimacy connection to both the target of the
        Charm and whomever the flame Represents. The strength is the strength of the relationship, however
        like all uses of Intimacy there is a two step penalty when using an inanimate object as a proxy.</p>

        consenting patient before she invokes Panacea, doing so causes them to burst into flames as per the
        strength of their feelings for the Princess (or somebody who is emotionally present). This fire will not
        harm the patient or the Princess but it will paralyse the patient and can spread to nearby flammable
        objects or terrify witnesses. So long as the patient remains aflame the Princess adds it’s Intensity as

    <p>The Princess destroys all poisonous substances within her patient’s body with nothing more than a

    <p>The Queen of Storms knows that mortals forget their sufferings in time, and teaches her dedicated
        followers a way to repair this flaw. The Princess may use this Charm on a target who has recently been
        injured, physically, mentally or socially. The threshold to reach depends on how long ago the injury
        was; 1 success reaches an injury in the past week, and each success beyond the first doubles the interval.
        On reaching the threshold, the target’s emotional state returns to where it was when he discovered the
        injury, and his memories of events since then seem vague and unimportant.</p>
    <p>Until the Charm ends, the target get’s the Cursed Condition: He has a -2 penalty to resist any
        suggestion that he revenge himself upon those who injured him and a -2 penalty to recall anything his
        enemy did in apology, or any penalty he paid – though if restitution was made to the target’s satisfaction,
        and he remembers this, the Charm ends immediately. In addition the target gets the Blessing Condition
        which provides a +2 bonus on attempts to take that revenge. The bonus and penalties apply to whoever
        the target believes injured him, even if he is mistaken.</p>
    <p>Bringing back someone’s outrage at an injury triggers a Princess’ innate sympathy with suffering.

    <p>No matter how may of her Heirs fail spectacularly the Queen of Mirrors never shows pause in her

        different reason. They say that unable to bear the weight of so many failures she has chosen to forget
        about them and so she crafted a Charm to do just that. Only those Princesses with memories of the
        Palace of Five Folded Stars itself remember that the Queen of Mirrors was once the Hierophant-Queen.

    <p>Somebody Else’s Problem erases the user’s memories. It’s as simple as that. This Charm can take

        The Princess knows only that she has erased her own memory. No magic or psychological technique

        about the topic. The effects of all Sensitivity rolls during the forgotten time are nullified, including
        Conditions and new Shadows. Somebody Else’s Problem cannot give free dots of Belief, but erasing
        all memory of a Belief Compromise will allow a Princess to buy back lost Belief with experience and
        erase and Conditions from the Compromise roll. The experience cost is purely an out of character

        With a snarl, the bonds of the mind are broken.</p>
    <p>The Princess may use this Charm on anyone currently affected by a supernatural power that alters
        their emotional state. If she is affected by an applicable supernatural power she may reflexively use this

    <p>If the Princess gets more successes than the power’s wielder did when they activated it, the power’s
        effect is overridden by a feeling of intense, nauseated rage, and the target suddenly becomes aware that

        perpetrator, the Princess gains the same benefit on any roll to persuade the target to avenge himself
        on the perpetrator, using the Inverse Curse Condition. The Charm also works on powers that don’t
        require a roll to activate (such as a vampire’s blood bonds). To defeat these, the Princess must get more
        successes than the supernatural advantage of the perpetrator.</p>

        subject to more than one eligible effect, the Charm breaks the least potent, and among effects of equal
        strength it breaks the one with the shortest remaining duration.</p>

    <p><b>Upgrade: Shattering (Tempesta ••••)</b><br>
        <b>Cost: </b> +1 Wisp<br>
        The Princess can break chains forged in deeper layers of the mind. Supernatural powers that alter
        memories or instill compulsions become vulnerable to the Charm, as does possession by a spirit or
        ghost. As with emotional influences, the Princess must get more successes than the power’s user did
        when activating it, or than the user’s supernatural advantage for unrolled effects.</p>
    <p>When used on a compulsion, the Charm transforms the effect into a urge to attack the perpetrator;
        should the target lack the means to do so, he will act to frustrate the perpetrator’s intent as best he
        knows it. Any rolls the target was entitled to make to resist the original compulsion, he may make to
        resist this urge as well.</p>
    <p>When used to break a false memory, the Charm sends the target into a bitter fury whenever the
        implanted memory would have arisen. When an effect simply suppresses a memory, the target is
        enraged whenever he recalls the memory that it suppressed. The Charm cannot restore a memory
        that was permanently removed - in this case the target becomes aware that his memory was altered,
        and feels sick rage at the violation for a few moments, but no longer.</p>
    <p>On any successful use of the upgraded Charm, the target experiences a sudden sharp headache, similar
        to a migraine attack, which inflicts 1 point of bashing damage. Targets who were already wounded
        have been known to suffer nosebleeds when the Charm took hold.</p>

    <p>The Princess is able to stave off another’s death and return him to life – though the experience is not a
        pleasant one, nor does it come free. The target must have died within the current scene, or the Charm
        fails. The sheer mental and emotional exertion required, and the traumatic process of dying result in
        the loss of a dot of Willpower for both the Princess and her target, and the ebbing of his life force causes
        his highest Attribute (if there is a tie, she chooses) to be reduced by one dot. He returns to life with
        a number of Health boxes equal to the activation successes filled with lethal damage and the rest filled
        with aggravated, and a -3 penalty to all actions due to the Reaper’s grasp upon him. Each week of rest

    <p>In a powerful feat of magic the Princess can purify entire fields of toxins and pollutants. For the purposes
        of this Charm any chemical which is seriously harmful to animals or plant-life, and which is not naturally
        created by a resident plant or animal is affected. She could scour oil slicks from the ocean (or at least
        part of one, given the sizes an oil spill can cover) and draw heavy metals out from the soil. The affected
        compounds are not destroyed or transformed, so the Princess will need a container to guide them into.
        Afterwords they can be recycled or disposed safely.</p>
    <p>One thing to bear in mind is that most pesticides would be affected by this Charm. That might be
        exactly what the Princess intended but it’s worth mentioning before you start the Charm in a farmer’s
        fields.</p>
    <p>The target number depends on how intertwined the pollutants are with the environment. Piles of
        litter sitting on the surface require three * Sanctuary Size Successes. Liquids that don’t fully mix, like
        oil on water, require four * Sanctuary Size Successes. Finally something like heavy metal pollution that
        gets into everything, soil, plants, animals, requires five * Sanctuary Size Successes.</p>

        to be within the affected area. While this Charm can’t get poisons out of animals body (only out of
        plants, soil or water) it can do stuff like clean the oil off birds.

    <p>The Princess manifests a protective shield around a circular area. She may create the shield around any
        area within sight, taking a penalty on the activation roll equal to the area’s radius in yards, and may do
        so in response to any action taken by another character within her line of sight. A bubble shield cannot
        form when it contain someone who does not wish to be contained. As a rule of thumb non-combatants
        that the Princess wishes to protect are acceptable targets.</p>
    <p>Normally creating a Bubble Shield takes an instant action, the Princess may forgo her Defence for a
        turn to invoke the shield as a Reactive action.</p>
    <p>Bubble Shields only last for a turn but if a Princess uses Bubble Shield to protect the same area as
        her next action, the new shield replaces the old with no gap of time.</p>

    <div class="failsucc">
        <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The shield fails to appear, and the Princess leaves herself open to attack. She has
        -2 to her Defense this turn; if she sacrificed Defense, she loses her action this turn.<br>
        <i>Failure:</i> The shield does not appear.<br>
        <i>Success:</i> The shield appears, taking the form of a bubble of pure magic. It will not cut through any
        solid object; if the shield cannot enclose an object it will stop at the object’s surface. In such cases
        the shield still forms a fully enclosed shape that presses tightly against obstructions. If there are no
        obstacles the shield simply forms a perfect sphere. The shield is not subject to the force of gravity -
        as long as it exists, it stays exactly where the Princess created it.<br>
        The shield blocks both movement and attacks through itself, in either direction, until the Charm ends.
Unlike normal objects the shield has no Durability, but it has a Structure of 3x the activation successes;
attacks made on targets on its other side are absorbed by the shield until the last Structure point is gone. (Should this happen the shield breaks, ending the Charm.) Damage in excess of the shield’s
Structure passes through to the intended target normally.<br>
        <i>Exceptional Success:</i> 
    </div>The shield will take a great deal of punishment before breaking.

    <p><b>Upgrade: Adamant</b><br>
        The shield behaves like a normal material, with Durability and Structure both equal to the activation
        successes. It provides transparent cover [GMC 200] against all attacks that must pass through it, in
        either direction. Removing the shield’s last point of Structure breaks it and ends the Charm, as before.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Elastic</b><br>
        The shield stretches when struck, and springs back unharmed; it is immune to bashing damage. Only
        lethal or aggravated damage will reduce its Structure.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Lasting</b><br>
        <b>Duration: </b>Inner Light turns<br>
        The shield endures for several actions before it must be renewed.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Partial</b><br>
        The shield can be shaped to cover parts of the circle, without surrounding the whole area; it can also
        be shaped as a flat plane.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Rainbow (Acqua •)</b><br>
        The shield manifests as an iridescent film, which bends light that passes through it. Attacks from
        outside on those inside, or vice versa, take a penalty equal to half your successes, rounded down.
        Attacks on the shield itself are not penalized. If Adamant is also applied, the shield instead provides
        opaque cover against attacks that pass through it.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Confining (Lacrima •)</b><br>
        The Princess may create the shield around anyone, even her enemies.</p>

        Like a brilliant pearl, the shield gleams richly in the light of the Noble’s soul. Against such beauty,
        who dares raise a hand? All sapient or sentient beings must pass a Resolve + Composure roll, with a

    <p>To qualify for this Charm the lock must be physical. A lock and key, a dial lock safe, a bolted door

        a physical lock. She could not use this Charm to disable an alarm. If supernatural defences are in place

        from it, burn normally. A Princess may use Fire’s Warm Kiss multiple times on one fire, until its damage
        has been reduced to 0. If a fire’s damage is reduced to 0, it cannot ignite anything and feels merely warm
        to the touch, though it still sheds light. It can even be scooped off its fuel source, held in cupped hands,
        and poured into a container, like a liquid with the consistency of thick syrup. Fire so treated ignites its
        container once the Charm wears off, or goes out after 1 turn if the container is not flammable.</p>

    <p>The Princess coaxes a plant to produce its harvest ahead of time. If she isn’t touching a plant
        reasonably near maturity or at least large enough to produce its crop, or if anyone has used the Charm
        on the plant within the past season, the Charm fails. (The plant must also have adequate soil and not be
        severely deprived of water or sunlight, but it need not be in season.) The normal use of this Charm is to
        obtain edible fruits, nuts, and/or berries from appropriate trees and bushes – in this case, each success is
        as effective as two successes in foraging by mundane methods, but successes in excess of the plant’s Size
        are wasted. Alternatively, it’s quite possible to use the Charm more frivolously (e.g. to produce lots of
        flowers) or productively (to get lots of acorns from an oak tree or other appropriate seeds, for example).</p>
    <p>The crops are guaranteed to stay fresh at least one day per dot of Legno unless some supernatural
        effect gets in the way. Nature’s Harvest does not harm the plant.</p>

        The plant grows under the Princess’s touch, even if it began as a mere seed; it achieves up to (activation
        successes) or its natural maximum in Size, whichever is lower, over the same number of minutes, and produces the
        expected harvest in the process. (The plant’s growth will generally be limited by available
        soil for its root system.) Once the Charm is complete, the newly-grown plant remains a normal plant
        of its species (although it’s advisable to water it well if one wants to keep it around).

        The plant no longer requires adequate soil, sunlight, or anything else as long as there’s enough room
        for its base to be planted in the earth. However, the Charm’s magic will only sustain the plant for
        (Legno) minutes after its growth is complete – if it doesn’t have enough water and room to grow, it
        obviously won’t last long.</p>

        She can grow oranges from an apple tree, apples from a pine tree, or roses from a barrel cactus if she
        chooses. A single activation produces a harvest of just one species of plant.</p>

        where it is appropriate. For example, in an interrogation, the ability to scar with acid can be used to get a bonus to Intimidate, while when opening a lock, the ability to dissolve the hinges gives a bonus

    <p>Manipulating a reflection is child’s play for a Brat, and it shows, by spending a wisp a Princess

        This reflection works just like the original, guns fire, phones make calls, but there is one exception: The

    <p>The Princess can create magical simulacrum of items by pulling them from her bottomless bag at will.
        To do so she must first acquire a stock of ten roughly similar items such as a pile of chocolate bars, which
        may be of different brands or flavours, and place them into her bottomless bag. Then, by spending a
        wisp she creates a magical duplicate of each item. So long as she has Wisps to spend she can do this
        infinitely. Removing the magical duplicates from the bag works like normal, save that the Princess always
        chooses randomly between the copies currently in the bag. This charm creates a separate compartment
        so neither the seed items or their duplicates count towards the item limits for Miss Poppin’s Bottomless
        Bag.</p>
    <p>The duplicated items must have an Availability rating of one. This limit increases by one dot at Inner
        Light three, six and nine. They are magical constructs and fade away at the end of the scene whether
        or not they have been used. A Princess may keep only one set at a time.</p>

    <p>Upon purchasing this Charm, the Princess adds a securely fastened bag or pouch of some kind to her
        Regalia. Activating the Charm unlocks the bag for a scene, after which it can be used freely. The
        Princess may store any number of items in the bag indefinitely, as long as each item is small enough to
        fit through the opening, and is light enough for her to lift without help. The Size of an object being stored
        or removed cannot exceed half the Princess’ Inner Light (rounded up), unless she applies an Invocation
        when she unlocks the bag. If she applies an Invocation, she can store objects of Size up to her dots in
        the Invocation; the objects are the Charm’s targets, so to apply an Invocation at no cost, all the objects
        stored or removed must be costless targets for that Invocation.</p>
    <p>Putting an object in the bag is an instant unrolled action. Taking an object out is also an instant
        action, and succeeds automatically as long as the number of items in the bag is less than Inner Light +
        Larceny. If the number equals or exceeds this limit, the Princess must roll Wits + Larceny to find the
        right item in among the clutter; she takes a penalty on this roll of -1 for each item in the bag over Inner

    <p>Items that are put into the bag are safe from harm and protected from loss, as they are bound to the
        Princess rather than the bag itself. However, they aren’t held in stasis; food will spoil if kept long enough.
        Moreover, while the bag is closed air can’t get into it, so anything living will suffocate if trapped inside
        when the bag locks. Should the Princess herself die all items in the bag are lost. With the appropriate
        supernatural power it is possible to steal from a Princesses bag, but doing so requires a Clash of Wills.</p>

        The Princess can stuff a very large object into her bag. Double the maximum Size of items the bag
        can normally hold; the Princess can put one object up to that Size into the bag at a time. As long as
        that object is in the bag, the Princess can’t put anything more into it, or take anything else out - the
        large object must come out first. If the bag locks before she takes the large object out, the Princess
        must apply Stretched again to remove it.

    <p><b>Upgrade: Conjured (Aria ••)</b><br>
        The Princess can pull things kept in the bag out of thin air. When she applies Aria to take something
        from the bag, it appears in her hand as a reflexive action, ready to be used in the same turn. The
        object so taken returns to the bag again just before the start of the next turn. (This allows weapons

        withdraws them without a roll, no matter how many other things are stored inside. She may rearrange
        the objects within the bag, putting a different set on top, as with a few minutes as an unrolled action.</p>

        <i>Success:</i> The object animates, responding to the Princess’ will. As long as the Princess concentrates,
        she may take mundane actions that manipulate the object’s internal mechanisms - pushing buttons,
        flipping switches, turning knobs, and so forth. She cannot pick the object up, or directly move it
        from its location; actions which require that fail automatically. Thus, the scope of possible actions
        depends on the complexity of the target object. A simple tool with no moving parts can’t do anything;
        a gun can be made to unlatch its clip, or to fire, but can’t be aimed; a car can be made to start its
        engine and drive itself; a computer can be operated almost normally, except for plugging in cables and
        peripherals. The Princess cannot control the object if she loses sight of it, and the Charm ends when
        she stops controlling the object. If someone else is using the object at the same time the Princess
        controls it, that starts a Clash of Wills; a mundane operator uses the same dicepool for the Clash as
        he does for operating the device.<br>

        The modern world runs on electricity, but when that’s lacking, the Princess can create a few sparks to
        get it moving. When the targeted object is a machine powered by electricity, the Princess may turn
        an extra Wisp into the power it requires, so it will run with a dead battery or while unplugged during
        the Charm’s duration. However, a dramatic failure when activating the Charm overloads its circuits -
        remove points of Structure equal to the Princess’ Inner Light.

        The targeted object, once animated, will carry out the Princess’ wishes without her conscious attention.
        The Charm does not end if the Princess stops concentrating on the object; during any turn when the
        Princess does not control it, the object repeats whatever action she most recently used it for. The
        object can’t adapt to changed circumstances, and will continue mindlessly repeating itself until the
        Princess controls it again or the Charm ends.

        to recognize, the object has a Perception dice pool equal to the Charm’s activation successes.</p>

        The Princess may set her will not on a solid machine, but on the air
        that surrounds her. Until the Charm ends, she can manipulate any object that she can see, as long
        as operating that object is covered by the Skill she used to activate the Charm. The Princess cannot

        Darkness. She may apply the Dark Lure condition to any object, except the Focus of a Tainted Place.
        The Lure’s radius is equal to the activation successes x 100 yards.</p>

    <p>The Princess crafts a useful tool from whatever material is at hand. The materials need not be appropriate
        for her desired tool but they must be in the same ball park. For example to create a shovel she will
        need wood or plastic for a handle and metal for the blade, but a few aluminium cans and a pile of twigs
        could create a shovel superior to any mundane object. Once she has reached the required successes she
        may continue rolling to add successes to the equipment bonus (with a maximum of +5). She can make
        anything that a skilled craftsman, such as a blacksmith, could create without power tools. Afterwords it
        functions as a mundane tool, the items created by this charm are not particularly well suited for combat,

        The Princess is freed from chains of logistics, she can craft tools from the very moisture in the air

        be a subsection of a larger fire, you don’t need to control an entire forest fire if your goal is to hold back

        travel along a solid surface. She may also shape it into complex shapes by rolling Dexterity + Crafts.
        However it is still fire, making a fire walk out of the hearth in the shape of a lion is a neat party trick,

    <p>The Princess enchants a Consecrated place, creating an enormous invisible dome of magic around it,
        the borders of this magical shield adhere to the edges of the consecrated ground. When any ranged
        attack, magical or mundane, attempts to cross the dome it instantly solidifies becoming both visible and
        impenetrable. For the remainder of the scene the barrier is essentially a solid transparent object. It has
        a structure equal to the Charm’s Activation Successes - Sanctuary Size and a Durability equal to the
        Princess’ Inner Light or any applied Invocation, whichever is higher. At the end of the scene where the barrier blocks an attack the Charm ends, unless the Princess spends a Wisp and a Willpower point to
        extend the duration for an additional scene.</p>
    <p>Any attack which penetrates the barrier will leave physical gaps, as though the barrier was a solid
        object. Attackers may use aimed shots to shoot through holes left by a successful attack or attempt to
        create an opening through which attackers can enter. Security minded Princesses make sure to choose
        defensible locations, because even a powerful Princess is unlikely to create a barrier that can stand up
        to a truck being driven into it at speed. Most Princesses just throw barriers around their family home
        because they don’t get to choose where their loved ones will live.</p>
    <p>Until the barrier blocks an attack anyone may pass through. Once the barrier solidifies only the
        Princess herself may pass through the barrier and she does so as though it was not there. She may also
        shoot through the barrier using Levinbolt or other magic, however if the Princess uses a mundane gun
        the barrier will not recognise the bullets as the the Princess’.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Garrisoned</b><br>
        Modified by commonality<br>
        The Princess names an organisation when she activates the Charm, and applies the Commonalty
        modifier for that organisation. Members of the organisation can pass through the barrier as though
        they were the Princess herself and may shoot through the shield with Levinbolt. Moreover, if any of
        these members has a pool of Wisps, he can spend Wisps to sustain the dome just as the Princess can.
        Beacons may use a point of Willpower in place of a Wisp.</p>
    <p><b>Drawback: </b>Unless the Princess is a member of the organisation she looses all privileges of access and
        is treated as no better than a stranger by the shield.</p>

        function. The Princess names whichever border she wishes.
    </p>
    <p><b>Drawback: </b>The duration also decreases to 1 scene.</p>

    <p><b>Upgrade: Queen's Protection (Lacrima ••)</b><br>
        The Court of Tears will do anything to protect what they love, and the Ravens are among the best
        defenders in the Nobility. When calculating the durability of the barrier, double the Princess’ Lacrima
        up to a maximum of 10.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Rebuilding (Legno •••)</b><br>
        When the barrier is destroyed the foundations remain and begin creating a fresh shield. They begin
        immediately after the barrier falls, either due to taking too much Structural damage or due to a scene
        ending. After approximately 24 hours the new shield is ready to go.</p>

    <p>The Princess takes control of a body of water within sight, making it flow and push as she wills. The

        in that shape, it lifts and moves everything inside it with a Strength of 1. The Princess may gather the
        water into a taller mass of smaller radius to concentrate its power; each halving of the radius quadruples
        the water’s depth or height, and adds 1 to its Strength. She may also move the water in a wave or spout,
        carrying along whatever floats in it; the water’s top Speed is 8 if moved this way. The Charm does not create water – if the Princess gets more successes than she needs to control all the water available, the
        extra successes have no effect.</p>

    <p>The Princess creates a small building, no larger than sixteen feet by sixteen feet. Her structure is
        well made and will protect her from any reasonable amount of rain or cold but not from extreme weather
        such as a hurricane or even a normal day in a harsh desert. Against physical danger the walls have a
        durability of five and the doors will not open to anyone but the Princess and her invited guests.</p>
    <p>The drawback is that these buildings tend to be exceptionally noticeable, by default they follow
        a similar theme to the Princess’ Regalia but after applying an Invocation it will instead follow the

    <p>The Princess may build a more humble abode at a -3 penalty (though this breaks Specchio’s Ban).</p>

    <p><b>Upgrade: Forest Lodge (Legno •)</b><br>
        The Princess enchants her palace to protect against the environment of the Earth. No animal will

        weather further to her liking, adding one of the following effects:</p>

        <li>Biting: The North Wind brings forth the winter. The Extreme Cold Tilt [GMC 210] applies
            throughout the affected area with a -1 penalty or the existing penalty increases by -1 to a minimum
            of -5.</li>
        <li>Hailstones: Ice begins to fall from the sky. The Hailstones Tilt applies throughout the affected
            area.</li>
        <li>Icy: Freezing rain falls in the area, coating all surfaces in ice. The Ice Tilt [GMC 210] applies
            throughout the affected area.</li>
        <li>Snowing: Snow falls in great quantities, imposing the Blizzard Tilt [GMC 208] throughout the

    <p>The Princess cultivates an area into a calm, tranquil garden that bolsters the abilities of herself and her
        allies. She takes the appropriate supplies (ie, plants, seeds, soil, water, etc.) and augments them with
        her magic to create a grove that instills peace, confidence, and competence. The garden may have any appearance, though most Princesses who take this Charm follow the lead of Bonnie Getsuei and make

    <p>The Princess claps her hands, then touches them to the ground, and the earth buckles and shakes,
        pitching wildly and throwing her enemies off-balance. She applies the Earthquake tilt to a circular area
        with radius equal to the activation successes in yards.</p>
    <p>The Charm cannot be used if the Princess is above ground level. If she is underground the earthquake
        will be exceptionally potent, though it may simply cause a cave in destroying everything and potentially
        killing everyone nearby.</p>

    <p><b>Upgrade: Sheltering (Terra ••••)</b><br>
        People the Princess chooses, up to her Inner Light, are not affected by the Tilt. Their balance is
        enhanced and falling rocks avoid them. This protective magic is powerful but limited, if the Princess
        completely destroys the area she is in or it is otherwise implausible for somebody to be unaffected she
        cannot protect them.</p>

    <p>Beauty is the only true constant in the world, the Queen of Mirrors knows. Not personal beauty, for
        that can fade and die, but the beauty that comes from righteousness and enduring strength. It is the
        calculus of rule that inspires her to take beauty from fools who might waste it. The Enlightened learns
        to peel the beauty from others, and craft it into valuable gems. These gems also have metaphysical
        potency, and can be used to enhance magic. This Charm must be used against a target who is asleep,
        or otherwise incapacitated or restrained.</p>

    <div class="failsucc">
        <i>Dramatic Failure:</i> The noble can only mar her own beauty. She inflicts 3 points of aggravated damage,
        as the beauty peels away from her flesh, and furthermore suffers the “Ugly” Condition until all of this
        damage has healed.<br>
        <i>Failure:</i> She cannot properly get her fingers under the flesh, and inflicts a point of Bashing damage on
        the target, who if they are asleep can roll Wits + Stamina to wake. If she has not got the necessary
        number of successes by the time the roll has ended, the target wakes automatically, and the Princess
        suffers a point of Lethal damage, as her fingers wear away.<br>
        <i>Success:</i> Successes are gained. The target suffers a point of Bashing damage, and if they are asleep,
        may roll Wits + Stamina, at a -3 penalty to wake. Incapacitated or restrained targets have no such
        defence.<br>
        <i>Exceptional Success:</i> If 5 successes are gained in a single roll, the target does not take damage, and
        does not get a roll to wake. If five successes are gained over the target number, the Princess is feeling
        generous, and can leave a residual of beauty to the target; they do not gain the Ugly Condition, unless
        they had no dots in the Striking Looks merit to begin with. There’s no helping some people.
    </div>
    <p>If the required number of successes are attained, the princess peels the metaphysical beauty away
        from the face of her target, which comes away like a thin layer of skin, which then coalesces into a gem.
        If the target had no dots in the Striking Looks merit, it is a cheap stone, dull and lacking lustre, worth
        Resources 1. If they had Striking Looks 1, it is attractive and valuable, a moderate value sapphire,
        emerald or ruby (frequently matching the colour of their eyes) worth Resources 3. If the Princess is
        lucky enough to find someone with Striking Looks 2, it is a diamond almost without compare, worth
        Resources 5. An individual targeted with this Charm loses all dots in the Striking Looks merit, if they
        had any, and gains the Ugly Condition. The effects on appearance are not obviously magical; even the
        most beautiful target is recognisable themselves after this is used, merely... lacking the gleam of beauty
        they once had.</p>
    <p>The gems produced are metaphysically potent. When holding one in her hand, the Princess may,
        reflexively, cause it to crumble to dust, destroying it utterly. It adds a number of Successes equal to its
        resources value to any one roll of hers which are in line with the Specchio Invocation. The Princess who
        uses the gem need not be the Princess who created it. In addition, if taken to Alhambra, the followers
        of the Queen of Tears convert them into lantern fuel. If the gem is returned to the person it was stolen
        to, it need only be pressed against their forehead to restore their former beauty.</p>
    <p>Unless used on a consenting target, this is Inflicted Major Hardship on Another, and so is a Belief
        Compromise. Apply a -1 penalty. Knowingly using a gem created by Enduring Beauty without evidence
        that it was created consensually can also be a Compromise, there is no penalty to the roll.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Through the Looking Glass (Shape •••• Specchio •••••)</button>
<div class="content">
    <p><b>Action:</b> Instant<br>
        <b>Dice Pool:</b> Dexterity + Occult<br>
        <b>Cost:</b> 3 Wisps, 1 Willpower<br>
        <b>Duration:</b> Indefinite
    </p>
    <p>The Princess can enter the world behind any Mirror. Inside she will find a perfect reflection of everything
        the Mirror can see. This does mean that any text is backwards and climbing into a funhouse mirror is...
        weird. One thing worth noting about objects inside a mirror - including the counterpart of the mirror
        itself - is that they are entirely immovable and indestructible: the only way to affect them is to affect
        the real object they are reflections off. Real items the Princess brings with her behave as normal. Any
        person or item she brings into the mirror world will cast an intangible reflection back into the real world.</p>
    <p>Inside a mirror any area that cannot be seen by that mirror (from any angle) is nothing more than
        solid glass that stretches on for infinity, or until the next place visible from that mirror. By rolling
        Specchio (no Wisp cost, this glass counts as targeting a Mirror) the Princess may carve out one Size
        point of Material per Success. This creates a little hidey hole invisible from the outside world perfect for
        storing weapons, valuable Bequests or bringing boyfriends you don’t want your mother to know about.
        These hidey holes last until the mirror is destroyed or moved, Once either occurs nothing, not even
        returning the mirror to it’s origonal spot can recover any stored items. No one knows what happens to
        a person lost this way but it probably isn’t pretty.</p>
    <p>While inside the mirror any area that usually can be seen by that mirror but cannot due to
        circumstance, say someone’s thrown a blanket over the mirror in the real world, is covered by pure
        darkness (no relation to the Outer Dark) that numbs all five senses. This however is not any more
        dangerous than normal sensory deprivation and some Princesses even make use of it for such.</p>
    <p>Two mirrors reflecting the same area will lead to the same mirror world, though parts of it may well
        be separated by walls of glass. This world would be safe until the last mirror is removed. However two
        mirrors set up to reflect each other can be quite dangerous. While inside the mirror world you can use
        the second mirror to recursively enter a second mirror world. Some Princesses use sequences of mirrors
        as elaborate “passwords” but the risk of being lost forever in an ever deeper chain of worlds means most
        stay far away.</p>
    <p>Exiting the mirror world requires using this Charm a second time. Any Princes who knows this
        Charm can also escape by simply jumping through the mirror. Knowing the Charm permanently gives
        a Princess the ability to bypass the usual indestructibility of reflected objects for this one purpose. Of
        course, this has all the usual effects of jumping through glass.</p>

    <p><b>Upgrade: Secure</b><br>
        By spending 1 Wisp a Princess can fix a mirror in place. It gains Durability equal to her Specchio
        against both damage and any attempt to move it requires Specchio successes on a Strength + Athletics
        roll. This Upgrade is meant to provide security for a Princess’ use of a mirror world, using indestructible
        mirrors as defensive positions should not be permitted. Charms do depend upon the emotions that
        invoke them.</p>
    <p>This durability does not apply to deliberate attempts to smash (say, by jumping through) the mirror
        by the princess herself, it does however cover accidents.</p>
    <p><b>Upgrade: Leading</b><br>
        With this Upgrade the Princess can now lead others through Mirrors. Each extra person or five Size
        points of equipment costs an additional Wisp.</p>
    <p>The Princess does not have to go first. It is acceptable to push someone through with the intent of
        trapping them.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Stone Servitor (Shape ••••• Terra •••)</button>
<div class="content">
    <p><b>Action:</b> Extended<br>
        <b>Dice Pool:</b> Presence + Crafts - Durability (1 minute/roll, threshold = 10)<br>
        <b>Cost:</b> 3 Wisps, 1 Willpower<br>
        <b>Duration:</b> 1 scene
    </p>
    <p>More than any other Court the Princesses of Hearts wish to become leaders, and just sometimes when
        they have no followers they can create their own from the Earth itself. Performing this Charm requires
        eight size points worth of stone or Earth and the target material’s Durability is subtracted from the roll,
        normally the bare soil beneath her feat will be sufficient (it’s certainly easier and less destructive than
        animating a building’s wall).</p>
    <p>When the Princess reaches the Threshold make one final roll to determine the servitor’s attributes.
        If this roll scores no Successes the Servitor is still created, but weaker.</p>
    <p>As a mindless being Servitors use the same Power, Finesse and Resistance attributes as Ephemerial
        Beings. They do not however have Banes or Bans. Servitors begin with one dot in each attribute and the Princess may assign an additional Inner Lights + Successes dots to each attribute, up to her maximum
        Transformed Attribute rating as determined by Inner Light. In addition a Servitor’s size is seven and
        it’s speed is equal to Power (they’re not very fast), however if they get up a head of steam they can
        really get going. A Servitor can sprint up to four times it’s normal speed, but it can only accelerate or
        decelerate by it’s speed every turn without running into a wall (and sometimes not even then).</p>
    <p>Unlike many such magical constructs a Princess’ Servitor is powered by emotions, beliefs and intent.
        As such it is very good at understanding it’s instructions. For example if a Princess instructs it to build
        a wall it will understand exactly where the Princess wants the wall and how she wants it, at least as
        well as the Princess herself knows her own desire. If she tells it to put a box in the car the Servitor will
        understand she wants it to open the door first (whether it’s fingers can gently open a door is another
        question). What a Servitor can’t do is react to changing circumstances without the Princess giving it
        fresh instructions, if she asks it to dig a well it will dig straight through any historical artefacts it might
        uncover.</p>
    <p>In battle servitor’s are deadly, but slow and clumsy. For this reason their attack dicepool is Finesse
        alone, however their fists are treated as weapons with a Damage rating equal to Power, maximum of five.
        Regardless of their actual strength, being hit by a large mass of stone is dangerous and causes lethal
        damage. Servitor’s also have Armour equal to half their Resistance (round down). Servitors act at the
        same initiative ranking as the Princess who created it. They are also vulnerable to being hijacked by
        magic, though if their creator is nearby she can defend her creation by initiating a Clash of Wills. If a
        Servitor is injured it can be healed by magic, the Charm Stitch will do it, but without magic it has no
        ability to heal.</p>
    <p>A Princess may only ever have one servitor at a time.</p>

    <p><b>Upgrade: Tireless Duty</b><br>
        The Princess can create a Servitor that will last indefinitely, barring physical destruction. The
        drawback is that, in addition to the increased cost, the Princess cannot change it’s instructions after
        it has been given it’s first and only orders.</p>
    <p>If the Princess changes her mind or the Servitor completes it’s duty then she may regain her Willpower
        Dot (or her experience if she as already brought back her Willpower) by touching the Servitor and
        withdrawing her magic. Even if the Servitor is destroyed the Princess can recover her magic so long
        as it’s ruby heart is intact. The ruby heart has only one point of structure but a Durability equal to
        the Princess’ Inner Light + Terra.</p>
